            Thank you so much for reading my book!

            I thank God that I was able to write this work. I hope that one day an American director will create a movie about this sensational story :D . Always have a nice day, and once again Thank you.

            The Alpha, Chapter 1
            
            PAGE 1
            
            In the year 2353, after many advances and setbacks, a group of scientists and programmers created a being they called perfection, the eleventh line of Android Robots, called the creation of man, a unique Android with human feelings. A perfect machine, in all aspects, however... nothing is perfect!
            
            From outside an experiment room, several scientists are prepared to test the being in which they created. The first test would just turn it on, to see how this would behave. Scientists named him ELEVEN for being the first, eleventh line of androids. Created by ECMI, cybernetic technology laboratory, "Enterteinament Cibernetic Machine Intelligence". The most famous artificial intelligence laboratory in the world, in Montpellier, France
            
             
            
            PAGE 2
            
            At exactly 11 am they decide to take the test, to test how the android will react, with only its human capabilities and human intelligence, with its experiment ,Robins Valkier , a black man with the appearance of about 35.36 years. bald, tall and muscular, with a little beard and eyeglasses and dressed in a white scientist's coat.
            
            - Yes, it's time to get down to business, can I turn it on? - Says Willians Robert, a fat white man about 1.64 tall, with long hair and ponytail style, with sunglasses, and white scientist coat appears to be about 45 years old.
            
            - Yes, expect to be 11 o'clock sharp - says Kelly, a slim blonde scientist ,who appears to be 1.70 tall, blonde with hair tied in a bun, blue eyes. she appears to be 40 years old.
            
            and there are many other scientists and staff around, waiting to see the "solution".
            
             
            
             
            
            PAGE 3
            
            After 11 o'clock, they turn on the light of the room where ELEVEN was, with the floors of smooth and blue floors, in a mirrored room, which you can see everything for those who are in the room on the other side, where the leading scientists and higher echelon and sponsors, looking behind the room, sitting around a big dark table and sitting in dark chairs and the room is green with white lighting, very modern room. and the others in the lower echelon witness ELEVEN across the workers' hall through a hologram reflector screen that shows ELEVEN in the room.
            
            - Want a countdown? - Says Williams looking at the other scientists and sponsors with a look of fear.
            
            - It doesn't need a countdown, turn it on - Says Adriana another chief scientist, sitting in the room
            
            - Yes, turn it on. - Says Robins, sitting and tapping his fingers on the table rather anxiously.
            
            Williams activates android ELEVEN. The Androide looks at the mirror in the room and is watching himself for a few seconds and realizes that he is white , with " low hair , military cut " , lightly muscular and tall with 1.85 tall , and is naked in the room , ELEVEN tries to cover himself with both hands, but one of your hands is attached to a chain. Then he covers your penis organ with just one hand.
            
            - I am stuck ? where am I ? who am I ? And why this light? - ELEVEN says with concern, just like a man who doesn't know what happened to him.
            
            PAGE 4
            
            Robins motions for Williams to turn on the microphone. Willians makes an ok sign with his hand and opens a smile. everyone in the room has a huge smile of pride on their face.
            
            - Hi ELEVEN , My name is Robins , nice to meet you
            
            - I'm ELEVEN? My name is ELEVEN ? - Says ELEVEN in a serene and peaceful way
            
            - Yes, your name is ELEVEN, you are the one hero that is stuck.
            
            - Am I a hero? - Says ELEVEN confused - If I'm a Hero why am I stuck?
            
            - You're not stuck ELEVEN, you just don't remember what happened, but you're a Hero
            
            - I do not remember being a Hero, I just know that there is a thirst for justice in me. I don't know who I am, I just know I'm somebody, but I don't remember who...
            
            - Yes ELEVEN, you are a hero, little by little you will realize this
            
            PAGE 5
            
            Robins, signal Williams to turn off the robot. Williams , do it and say :
            
            - You're a genius at telling him you're a hero, but tricking him, it's not very good to do that.
            
            - True Robins, Williams is right - Norberto says one of the sponsors of the scientists, brown and tall, wearing dark glasses and a suit and tie. -Remember Astaraf is on the loose and committing disasters, and that's one of the reasons
            
            - It's Robins, you can't always fool them. - Says Adriana, one of the chief programmers, black, with a fit body, 1.80 tall, curly hair and glasses, formally dressed in one of the company's clothes, which is a blue knee-length skirt and a blue female jacket.
            
            page 6
            
            - Well on the one hand he is 100% with a sense of justice, and is peaceful. And calling him a hero was amazing, we called him a few days ago and he won't know who we are, he just knows he's a hero, literally he's a hero, right? - Says Robins with his hands on the table looking into the eyes of all
            
            - People Robins is right, he is the hero we created him to destroy the rest of the tenth lineage - Says Kelly
            
            - Well it was a success for me - Says Alejandro, one of the project's partici- pants, blond with his hair combed back, tall in a suit and tie.- He seems to be very human, it's not like those disasters you built from the tenth line
            
            - Well, then we can celebrate, The first test was a success, the test as agreed was to know if he had a notion of who he was and where he was and if he would react with violence to the current. Well, nothing bad happened, so let's celebrate. -Says Robins
            
            PAGE 7
            
            - I don't agree.- Says Derick, one of the programmers, a young white guy with glasses, tall thin, curly hair and wearing a white coat. a guy with the appearance of about 25 years and with a nerd face.- We need more tests, many... and this one was extremely fast.
            
            - Yes, Derick, but everything needs to have a beginning. let's celebrate .- Says Robins taking a champagne and glasses from the cupboard and opening it
            
            Everyone celebrates the success, those in the lounge toast with champagne and those in the lounge toast with beer and wine.
            
            After a full day of partying and drinking, Robins places his hand on the left door of his autonomous car and the car identifies, Robins opens the door. Robins enters the car and gives the command to go home and lie down, and turn on the hologram TV in the car, lie down and start watching the news.
            
            page 8
            
            Female reporter , Channel 6 :
            
            - French Chancellor, was brutally murdered this Monday morning by an android of the 9th line. He was murdered inside the house , the camera record captured the whole moment , beware strong scenes
            
               In the camera record, the android in which he was doing security and day and night rounds at the chancellor's house, on the day at 13 and 30, takes an ax and attacks his neck so hard from behind, that the only thing he can do is if you see it is the chancellor falling to one side and his head going to the other, and the images on the hologram TV are blurry so as not to show the chancellor's body and head.
            
            News reporter :
            
            - Alleging that the 9th lineage Android was hacked by another 10th lineage android, we spoke to one of the chancellor's sons this afternoon who witnessed it all across the courtyard.
            
            page 9
            
            Chancellor's son:
            
            - I, I, I saw everything, he attacked my father out of nowhere... and he kept looking at me as if everything was normal, these freaks have to stop.
            
            - But your father had about 6 androids of the 9th lineage and was a full supporter of those androids, right?
            
            - Yes ! he believed that the androids would protect him much more against a bloodline 10 or a bloodline 9 cracked, than an improved soldier, but unfortunately someone cracked one of the androids.
            
            - And why the android did not attack you?
            
            - I don't know... I thought he was going to kill me too, but he looked at me and continued walking as if nothing had happened, I told everyone to go outside, the human employees, but the robots also obeyed me, because they also obeyed me. obey.
            
            PAGE 10
            
            News reporter :
            
            - So you gave the order for everyone to leave? and even robots obeyed him?
            
            - Yes , the weird thing is that two robots that saw my father 's body when they left , became obsolete
            
            - And the ones who didn't see it?
            
            - Those who didn't see it left the house and stayed outside with the human employees who didn't see my father's body either.
            
            Robins turns off the hologram TV. Phone ringtone, on Robins hologram watch, Robins look, it's called Kelly.
            
            Robins clicks the button and Kelly appears on the screen.
            
            - You already know what happened this morning, at the same time as the presentation of ELEVEN? - says Kelly with a blue formal clothes, already at home.
            
            page 11
            
            - Yes , I saw , look the ninth lineage androids are more than efficient to work in our service . ok , if they were cracked , it was because someone activated the internet on one of them ! they have some intelligence capacity, but not like a 10th-lined android. Good night, we'll talk tomorrow - Robins turns off the hologram clock.
            
            Robins' car arrives and enters the garage alone, Robins sends the car door open and the car opens, gets out and it closes.
            
               Robins swipes his owner ID card and the door opens and he enters. walk down the hall, go to the bathroom, have the bathtub appear, open a hole in the floor in the shape of a bathtub, Robins asks for hot water and a massage and the bathtub obeys, Robins sits down and relaxes, then Robins gets up, dries and goes to kitchen , order whiskey from the fridge , and put the glass down and put the whiskey down . Robins takes a sip, puts the glass in the sink and goes upstairs. when Robins arrives his wife is sleeping on her side. Robins lies on the bed with his belly up and one arm resting on his head. His wife turns around and kisses him.
            
            page 12
            
            - How was it, did you test Android? - Says Melissa, wife of Robins, a blonde of about 1.65 in height, blue eyes, long hair and slightly curly, a body with a lot of curves, with the age of about 25 years.
            
            - Yes love, everything worked!
            
            - Isn't he a psychopath like Astaraf ?- Melissa says kissing him on the cheek
            
            - No, on the contrary, unlike Astaraf the test was quite peaceful.
            
            - I hope he destroys all the androids of the 10th first lineage - says Melissa
            
            -Yes love - Robins says kissing her on the head.
            
            - That deserves a reward - Melissa says with a sexy look
            
            page 13
            
            Melissa gives Robins healed abdomen by licking it on the bed, pulls her sleep pants and strips Robins, gives a smile and then kisses Robins cock, Robins closes her eyes and starts to feel Melissa's mouth going and coming on his cock, and all that Robins sees when he opens his eyes is see Melissa with her blonde head coming and going very slowly and she looking at him deep in her eyes, Robins sees Melissa's eyes shining, then Robins, he tells her to go on top, Melissa obeys, and sits in an exceptional way, Robins sees Melissa's breasts sway as she feels the openness that Melissa makes her vagina, after about 30 minutes like this, Robins says he's going to ejaculate, Robins squeezes Melissa around the waist and jams her member in Melissa who leans on the lap of her uterus, and ejaculates hot inside. Melissa smiles, lies down on Robins and says in her ear:
            
            - You always send very well my nigga .- says Melissa standing on top of robins and kissing him on the mouth
            
            - You too sweetie - Robins says, feeling the kiss, Melissa's hair and her scent of jasmine perfume and hair cream.
            
            PAGE 14
            
            Robins goes to sleep:
            
            (Robins walks through the company and sees several people lying on the floor and when he arrives at the laboratory, he sees Willians lying down holding one of his hands on his pierced chest and with blood coming out of his mouth)
            
            Williams:
            
            ( - Ro, Ro, Robins, Robins, Robins he's gone mad run away Robins, Robins, Robins )
            
            - Robins, Robins, love - Melissa
            
            - huh? what ? - Says Robins scared, runs his hand over his beard, and realizes he was just dreaming
            
            - Love your alarm clock rang about 3 times and then I decided to wake you up. it is good too ? - Says Melissa with her hair still messed up and in her nightwear sitting on the edge of the bed.
            
            page 15
            
            - Oh yeah, I'm fine - says robins sitting on the bed with one hand on his head
            
            - Did you have a nightmare?
            
            - Yes, no biggie
            
            - And how it was ?
            
            - Love dreams are just dreams, you know that and thank you for waking me up. - Robins gets up from a kiss on Melissa's head and goes down the stairs, takes a shower and takes just a cup of coffee and goes to the company.
            
            Robins is going to the company lying in his autonomous car and while reading a book, the traffic stops at the light and Norberto makes a call to him on the hologram clock.
            
            Robins answers:
            
            - Hello Norberto... Good morning!
            
            page 16
            
            - Good morning, Robins. is... the Subject you already know, we need more guys like ELEVEN to profit! and see if there is ae in the hologram man, you always have this shyness that gives a certain nervousness. - Norbeto says in a fast tone and with a certain nervousness
            
            - Look, well, we still won't be able to make copies or models of ELEVEN, we would need to do numerous tests, so that no more disasters happen. - Says Robins by audio only
            
            - Yes, Robins, but look at the financial hole my friend that you and the world suffered thanks to you, with lineage 10, friend, you owe to God and the world, literally. the disasters made by you rebelled like the fallen angels in the bible. In other words, in case ELEVEN is compatible, my friend, an ELEVEN here and there, you understand? to protect the population from the numbers 10 . By the way I want to know if he is compatible for combat like the 10 lineages , which are much superior to the 9 , 8 and 7 lineages .- Norberto says with a nervous face adjusting his tie

            - Yes, let's make a combat test on ELEVEN, we did it with 100% reflex and combat intelligence, and with some abilities that the 10 bloodlines don't have.
            
            - Friend, do you remember the 8th setback because of lineages 9, which were hacked thanks to the internet ?and that we used Astaraf as a leader and combatant against lineages 7,8 and 9 ? so friend , let 's say that Astaraf created new war strategies that even we humans never imagined creating . the lineage 7 in the 7th throwback also did that and we started using lineage 8 androids against them, and it was insufficient to stop the lineage 7 androids being extremely dumb and so later we created the lineage 9 robots with intelligence limited artificial , which could only turn against the human race if hacked by a super hacker and who hacked them ? an android from line 7 that has been "extinct". and now who hacks the lineage 9 androids are the demons created by you, the lineage 10 androids, and we don't know for sure if there are the lineage 7 androids hidden by ae . And you could show your face on the hologram at least once right, I don't feel comfortable talking to you like this, we seem to go back 500 years.
            
            page 18
            
            -Yes you are covered with reason, we can't go wrong, in the error of creating a snake to bite us again. and more... we created Astaraf , but who multiplied the lineage 10 androids was the government, for protection... Ahh, and have a nice day
            
            Robins turns off the hologram in Norberto's face, and goes to the company.
            
            Arrive , get out of the car and get on the elevator , to your office at the top .
            
            Robins arrives in the living room, takes off his suit and puts it on the chair, gets some coffee from the machine and sits in his chair and turns on a hologram with information about ELEVEN's psychic state.
            
            Williams knocks on the door that is already open and says:
            
            - Can I ? good morning, great man! - and goes out into the room and messing with things
            
            - Since you're inside, you can. Good Morning.
            
            page 19
            
            - Look, I was watching earlier today about ELEVEN, I thought it was extraordinary, sensational, perfect. - Says Willians scratching one hand over his head
            
            - His brain is human, mixed with that of a machine, the interesting thing is that he dreams, sensational big guy, he's practically a human.- Williams says with a smile
            
            - Yeah, we did a great job. - Says Robins looking at the hologram giving little importance to Williams
            
            tap the hologram desk phone ... Robins looks and says :
            
            - It's Kelly.
            
            - She didn't come to work today?
            
            - I don't know... I better not answer -Robins hangs up the company hologram phone
            
            page 20
            
            Williams sits down and turns on the hologram clock, puts on a wireless headset to relax on, and puts on a rock song from the 1983 years, a song from 370 years ago. Kelly calls him . Willians sees him and thinks it might be something important and answers , while Robins sees and analyzes some ELEVEN stuff .
            
            - Big guy... you were supposed to pay attention, man, it's something... - Willians says with a scared and scared face
            
            - Which ? - Says Robins looking at Williams with glasses
            
            - Something - Says Williams, biting his nails
            
            - Says... - Says Robins in an impatient way
            
            - Scary, turn on Hologram TV. - Says Williams with his hand on his head in a state of concern
            
            page 21
            
            Robins turns on the hologram TV in his office:
            
            Reporter channel 3:
            
            - Norberto would make you junior, the businessman was brutally murdered by a robot, probably from lineage 10, with a hood and glasses. Inside his autonomous car, Norberto had his head blown off with a punch, which went through the bank, and left him unrecognizable. The robot that killed roberto is a brown colored robot and has tattoos.
            
            - We are here with the police chief of the 25th battalion, the suspect is an android of the 10th lineage?
            
            - Yes, probably... everyone knows that lineage 10 androids don't like to expose themselves, but they are completely impatient when someone says no to them and they will personally kill important people like Dr. Norberto. - Says the delegate looking from one side to the other, afraid of another attack
            
            page 22
            
            It's hopeless, even when these androids continued to run wild? , until when will we suffer - says the presenter of channel 3 with a sad tone .
            
            Williams and Robins look at each other and put their hands on their heads
            
            - Are you thinking what I'm thinking - Willians say
            
            Robins sits down and puts a hand on his head and doesn't say a word for a few minutes.
            
            Kelly invades Robins' room and asks:
            
            - None of you had any contact with Norberto at home, for God's sake
            
            -I talked to him today in the car, I'll have to throw my hologram watch away.- says Robins with one hand on his head in a state of worry
            
            page 23
            
            - The police are scared... Norberto talked to this android for about 30 minutes inside the car, and this android murdered him in cold blood. - Says Kelly with a holographic ipad in hand
            
            - The registration of cameras did not pass on TV, but look at this, on this site. The video has no audio. however, he is talking to someone on his holographic watch.
            
            - Yes... it was me - Says Robins
            
            - You didn't appear to him right? because I know you don't like to show your face on the holographic watch - Kelly says
            
            - Yeah, I didn't show up to him. I saw him , he heard my audios - Says Robins
            
            - Maybe he wanted you to appear to him at the request of that robot, so he could identify you. - Says Kelly
            
            - Yes , he always asked me to show up , I thought that was a bit weird - Says Robins taking off his glasses and cleaning it
            
               They watch the video of Norberto and the supposed android
            
            - Look, it's now, after the hologram is turned off they have a conversation for about 10 minutes, until he starts begging not to die, he tries to get a stun baton in the corner of the car, but the robot holds it around his neck with one hand and the other, he hits it so hard that it looks like Norberto's head is a tomato being smashed against the bench by a hammer.
            
            Williams vomits as he sees the scene in HD on his holographic ipad.
            
            Chapter 2, The Search
            
            Page 24
            
            Robins gets annoyed when he sees Williams vomiting on his desk in his office :
            
            - Wow, Williams... that shit man, you're gonna clean all this up.
            
            - Arg... I'm going to get out of here, you talked to Norberto today, I hope these freaks aren't on your tail. - Says Williams wiping his mouth on his shirt
            
            - Aberrations that we made, we created! - says Robbins looking at the table full of vomit
            
            - Wait guys... Willians is right, you have to go to my house and send Melissa to go there immediately. Before it's too late . says Kelly trying to calm the situation
            
            - Yeah, you're right - says Robbins
            
            Robbins turns on his Hologram Clock and calls Melissa.
            
            - Love... you take what you need and go to Kelly's house immediately. Have the auto-taxi take you there, I'll give you the address.
            
            page 25
            
            - Love , what happened ? - Melissa says
            
            - Love, don't waste time, just get in the car and go, I love you, kisses - Says Robins
            
            - Okay, good afternoon to you, I'm going. - Willians grabs his black leather jacket and leaves, walking fast and nervous
            
            "He's very scared," says Kelly with a mocking smile.
            
            - Is he wrong to be scared? Did you see how Norberto was murdered? is aware of how fragile we are compared to these... - Says Robins
            
            - Freaks ? for better or worse we create these beings. and Norberto he didn't even feel pain in his death. - Kelly says with one eyebrow raised without giving much importance to Norberto
            
            page 26
            
            - Sometimes I look at you and see that you really are a real scientist. For being too logical. However , if you were in Norberto 's place the expertise would find you you would be all shit and pissed too . - Says Robins giving a mocking smile
            
            Kelly laughs at Robins' lines:
            
            - Yeah, you have humor, he just wasn't tortured because the car has an alarm in case the owner calls for help - Kelly says
            
            - Yeah Kelly, you better shoot yourself in the head then ... if they catch you - Says Robins
            
            - Our big one was heavy, but you're right and I'll tell you something, get your jacket and come on, we'll have to tell our big guys that the company is in danger.
            
            page 27
            
            Kelly sends a message to Bill Wayven the president of the company saying that he would have to close after what happened, Bill who lives in Hawaii answers, and tells them to close all companies and laboratories that exist in the country immediately, after knowing that the 10 androids are attacking its partners.
            
            - Have you seen Bill Wayven? - says Kelly to Robins
            
            - No... I've never seen him. I don't know if he is white, black, tall or a dwarf. - Says sitting, stretching and yawns after speaking
            
            - I've never seen Bill Wayven either, he's always in the Caribbean, he owns 95% of our company's shares. and I thought you knew him. and stop yawning, I huh... not liking my presence? or are you sleepy. - Says Kelly
            
            page 28
            
            - I'm sleepy, and you know I love you - Robins says, making a heart sign with his hands at Kelly in a mocking way.
            
            - I know ... let's go - Says Kelly
            
            Kelly says over the loudspeaker that the company is on indefinite strike.
            
            Derick leaves his room, and goes to question Kelly
            
            - O-ola Kelly, good morning, good morning Robins, indefinite time? But what about ELEVEN? - Derick says with a cup of coffee in his hand.
            
            Kelly remembers ELEVEN, slapping his forehead twice without knowing what to do
            
            'We'll take him,' says Robins looking at Derick with eyes wide open behind his glasses.
            
            - Take you ? Are you crazy? Do you have Bill's authorization for this? - Says Derick with a face of, are you crazy?
            
            page 29
            
            - Yes, he gave us permission!
            
            - But ... - says Derick making a sign with the hand of who wants to talk more
            
            - Do you want to be fired? - Kelly says with a loud and firm voice - No more questions!
            
            Robins and Kelly go down the elevator.
            
            When they reach floor ELEVEN, Kelly approaches the door and the door opens. Kelly sends some security guards who are on the floor to pick up ELEVEN and put him on a stretcher, the security guards are surprised at the decision but obey. ELEVEN is heavy it takes 6 men to put it on the stretcher, they put it on the stretcher. Robbins and Kelly asks one of the security guards to push the stretcher to the elevator, the security guard obeys and takes the stretcher to the elevator and says:
            - Look, I'm sorry, but the order is for me to stay here on this floor
            
            page 30
            
            - Whose order? - Says Robins
            
            - From Dr. Adriana - Says the security guard
            
            - Ahh yes, alright, we'll take you to another sector - Says Robins muttering
            
               After the elevator arrives on the first floor, ELEVEN is covered by a gray blanket.
            
               Robins pushes the stretcher as fast as possible. meanwhile, the security guard calls Dr. Adriana, through the hologram clock, and asks if the orders were to remove ELEVEN from her. Dr. Adriana answers:
            
            - No way
            
            - Robins and Miss Kelly took him to another sector - Says security
            
            - Wait... I'll call Bill. - Says Adriana
            
                Bill answers and says he didn't give orders to remove ELEVEN from the sector and tells Adriana to close everything
            
            Adriana:
            
            - Look do not let them leave the building, Bill did not authorize it! lock everything up!
            
            page 31
            
               The doors closed immediately, after one of the security guards presses one of the emergency buttons, many employees not understanding anything and afraid. However, Robins and Kelly were already inside Kelly's car with ELEVEN lying on one of the sofas and were already outside the building.
            
            Adriana calls Robins and then calls Kelly, they don't answer. and Adriana texts Kelly, "You'll be sorry. I hope Bill fires you."
            
            - Wow, what a boring woman - says Kelly inside the car looking at the glass inside the car that is a mirror inside and out not even a robot can see inside for being anti-vision x-ray.
            
            - And what we did was crazy, but it was smart. if they killed Norberto, surely it's because he knows about ELEVEN.
            
            page 32
            
            - Yes , exactly , you had a very quick thought , to take ELEVEN but either they call the police and deliver us to robots and police , since Androids have all the police information through the phone lines , or they send others Robots behind us, so we're not going to my house, call Melissa and tell her to go to the Hotel Comparisson, we'll stay there indefinitely, but first I'll go down about 2 kilometers before the Hotel, I'll call one taxi and go to the Hotel by taxi, I will make the autonomous car go to a certain place by itself and explode as simple as that.
            
            - You're right - Robins says scratching his head with one hand and shaking a bottle of water with the other
            
            They arrive at the Hotel Comparison
            
            page 33
            
            Kelly opens the car door, she and Robins get out. Robins takes the stretcher closed and opens it , but ELEVEN is very heavy and has a gray blanket over him
            
            Kelly asks for the help of one of the lineage 9 Androids who works at the hotel to put ELEVEN on the stretcher
            
            Android puts him on the stretcher and pushes him into the hotel. Kelly, Robins and ELEVEN stay in room 65, and Robins is pushing the stretcher all by himself because the stretcher has a technology that helps to reduce people's weight naturally.
            
            Kelly and Robins sit and talk
            
            Melissa says she's reaching Robins through her hologram. After 30 minutes, Melissa arrives at the Hotel and does the same thing Kelly tells the autonomous car to go to a certain place and take about 25 minutes to explode.
            
            Kelly set the car to explode into a lake.
            
            Melissa put the car on high to explode in a junkyard
            
            Everyone starts playing a game of cards , eating pizza and drinking hot chocolate in the room , it is very cold , they are all wearing coats and blankets .
            
            page 34
            
            While ELEVEN is in the room "off, sleeping"
            
            Kelly asks the hotel host to bring her a French wine and a vodka, they drink and Kelly is weak to drink, Melissa also drinks like she doesn't hear tomorrow and Robins only has a glass of wine. However, Kelly gets drunk faster and starts saying things about Robins to his wife's face.
            
            - Yeah you're very lucky, I already had sex with Robins, before you started a relationship and got married, his dick is big and thick. - Kelly says in a completely drunk tone, all disheveled, dressed in a brown bearskin cold coat, underneath a green blouse and jeans and colorful and large socks.
            
            page 35
            
            - Hmm , yeah I know I'm lucky honey , thank you - Says Melissa also slightly drunk , dressed in a fluffy white coat , a pink blouse , with a black pants and medium white socks
            
            Robins puts her hand to her head because she knows Kelly is going to talk a lot and a lot, she's dressed in a furry black coat, a white blouse and jeans and small white socks.
            
            - Yes, I remember him putting me on all fours at my office desk and almost making me fly. Plus that was a long time ago, you're lucky. - Kelly says again, completely drunk. - But don't care, he doesn't cheat on you, not with me maybe with someone else, there are many women there that even I look at
            
            - Love, let's sleep? - Says Robins nothing drunk and worried about Kelly talking too much
            
            page 36
            
            - Relax love, we're having a healthy conversation
            
            Says Melissa curious to what Kelly has to tell and seems to be totally open to the subject
            
            Kelly and Melissa drunkenly begin to compare the limb size of men who have already had sex with the limb size of Robins, something no man ever wants to hear.
            
            Kelly asks if Robins and Melissa have ever had threesomes :
            
            - Have you ever had threesomes?
            
            - I already in college - says Melissa straightening her hair.
            
            - And who was the lucky one? - Says Kelly
            
            - None , it was me and two friends . Women know each other right dear . - Says Melissa laughing drunk and drinking pure vodka
            
            page 37
            
            - And as a friend, every real woman loves a pair of scissors with a friend, in fact it's cold. - Kelly takes the Vodka from Kelly's hands and turns around and starts laughing
            
            Kelly lets go of her hair, gets up and sits next to Melissa and covers her with the same blanket.
            
            - I've seen you by holography, but personally you are much prettier. says Kelly smoothing Melissa's hair and kissing her on the cheek
            
            - ruhumm - Robins mutters, thinking, seriously you're going to make out or seriously you're going to catch my wife in front of me for Kelly 
            
            Kelly and Melissa , do not even hear the murmur of Robins and start kissing , they are kissing for about 5 minutes , they are so drunk that Kelly forget that Robins is in the room . and looking. then Kelly looks at the Robins:
            
            page 38
            
            - Look at him, he wants to participate, right Robins - Kelly and Melissa look at Robins smiling.
            
            Robins pretends it's not him, picks up one of the playing cards on the table and watches the card.
            
            - Come love, it's cold. - Melissa says to Robins - If you haven't come we'll come to you
            
            Melissa and Kelly get up, start taking off their cold clothes, doing a striptease in front of Robins and the two laugh drunkenly. Robins is sitting in the chair, Kelly goes behind Robins' armchair and trips over Robins' foot and hears from Melissa:
            
            - Watch out - Melissa says, laughing
            
            - I almost spoil the game - Kelly says also laughing
            
            page 39
            
               Kelly starts licking his never, stroking his shoulders, while Melissa strips Robins with her hands on his knee and reaching with her breasts close to her face and then lowers and brings her mouth close to his mouth, which you feel your wine breath and your blond hair fall over you.
            
            Robins says:
            
            - Get out, you're drunk
            
            But Robins doesn't stop anything, and Melissa and Kelly don't even hear them drunk.
            
            Melissa takes off the blanket from Robins and puts her hand in her pants and says smiling:
            
            - It's hard as a rock
            
            - It's true that man wouldn't be - Kelly says also smiling and passing a hand over Robins shoulders.
            
            page 40
            
            Melissa takes Robins Penis out, starts to lightly masturbate it.
            
            Kelly sees and says
            
            - It's big... I miss seeing your friend
            
            Kelly goes around the chair again passing her hands on Robins arms and kneels beside Melissa, Melissa and Kelly start kissing with Robins cock between their mouths, their tongues running over his penis. Robins doesn't seem to believe it, it makes him very horny. Melissa challenges Kelly who can go deeper.
            
              Kelly accepts the challenge, Melissa swallows almost all of Robins' member and leaves and Kelly tries, chokes, starts to cough and vomits on top of Robins, Melissa starts laughing and Robins too, but Robins is very angry because she will have to bathe and say:
            
            page 41
            
            - I hope you don't remember that. - Says Robins smiling
            
            - I was good at it, you know that. -Kelly says coughing running to the bathroom to vomit even more in the toilet ..
            
            It 's 1:30 in the morning , Kelly takes a shower and after Kelly leaves Robins and Melissa shower together , wash and go out
            
            Kelly is dressed in bra coat and panties looking forward, still drunk and closes her eyes and begins to sleep sitting in one of the armchairs, Robins flexes Kelly's armchair so that it is like a bed and puts a blanket over her. Kelly already starts snoring and Melissa and Robins chuckle softly.
            
            - I hope she doesn't remember anything that happened - Robins says quietly and smiling at Melissa
            
            page 42
            
            - What really happened - Melissa says, pretending to have forgotten what happened in the morning and smiling.
            
            Robins and Melissa go to the bedroom and lie down on another bed on the side where ELEVEN is lying and sleep
            
            It's morning, Kelly is already in the living room drinking hot chocolate and fiddling with her holographic iPad
            
              Kelly looks at Robins with a super great face
            
            - Good morning madam, do you want a hug?
            
            - Good morning my ass , I remember yesterday , if you tell someone I will kill you ! - Kelly says pointing her finger at Robins speaking in a moderate and low tone
            
            - Look ... you don't know how to drink you don't drink, it's no surprise, you gave me oral sex, before I got married to Melissa you've done it to me many times the luck she's "liberal" - Says Robins doing sign in quotes
            
            page 43
            
            - Not that shame... I've never vomited on you - Melissa says
            
            - You were drunk ok, I know you were good at it. - Says Robins with a mocking tone.
            
            - You look like a kid man... do you want to remember that kind of thing?
            
            - I do not remember anything, you who remembered all this and in front of my wife. - Says Robins sitting in one of the armchairs reading a magazine.
            
            - Okay, okay ... it was my fucking mistake. But we're actually here because of your “fault”, so you and your wife are going to have to put up with my suicidal way of being,” Kelly says in a moderate, low tone because Melissa might be listening.
            
            page 44
            
            - Okay sweetie - says Robins, making a mocking heart for Kelly
            
            Kelly when she sees , sends the middle finger to Robins
            
            Kelly and Robins got involved about 5 years ago , became great friends , so there is all this respect between them with little fights between them
            
            Melissa wakes up and goes to the living room and says:
            
            - Good Morning
            
            - Good morning - Kelly and Robins respond at the same time.
            
            Melissa sits in one of the armchairs in the living room , the three of them are looking at each other 's faces , trying to pretend they don't remember anything that happened in the morning of the day
            
            page 45
            
            Melissa looks at Kelly, Kelly looks at Robins, Robins looks at Melissa, everyone looks at the floor. Kelly starts laughing, and everyone starts laughing, and laughing loudly. they stop laughing out of nowhere, and then they just go quiet, and they start laughing again and their stomachs start to hurt from laughing and then they stop again. Robins takes the Magazine and puts it in front so as not to see their faces , Kelly tries to hide behind the Holographic Reflector , but sees from behind the reflector Melissa with her cheeks puffed looking at the two trying to hold back her laughter , and Melissa starts farting with his mouth trying not to laugh.
            
            Kelly giggles lightly, and holds himself back with a stupid noise. And at the same time, the air comes out of Melissa's mouth and she tries not to laugh making a rhinoceros fart sound. and behind Robins magazine he presses his lips together so hard not to laugh that he farts for real. Everyone bursts out laughing, and laughs as they squirm.
            
            page 46
            
            and then stop out of nowhere, they're all quiet.
            
            Robins' hologram clock rings, everyone is quiet. And who is on the hologram clock is Williams, Robins answers:
            
            - big guy - Says Williams
            
            Everyone starts laughing again , Melissa says :
            
            - Big guy !
            
            And everyone is laughing even Robins is laughing.
            
            Williams is confused.
            
            - Is the marijuana good? Aren't you at Kelly's house? - Says Williams by audio
            
            - No... we're in room 65, in the Comparison, you can come - Robins says and hangs up
            
            page 47
            
            Everyone is quiet.
            
            - I'll order a snack for us - Melissa says
            
            - What are you going to order? - Says Robins
            
            - Hot dog - Melissa says.
            
            everyone starts laughing again
            
            - Melissa, about yesterday... I remember everything unfortunately - Kelly says with an "I can do nothing" look
            
            - I thought you had already had a sex to 3, normal what happened. you only threw up because you were completely drunk. If you want to try again in my presence and with me participating, and sober I'll do it. - Melissa says with a wink at Kelly

            page 48
            
            - Melissa, look unfortunately I was drunk. I sober only top if it's just you and me. Over the last 5 years I have discovered myself, understand ?- Kelly says with a serious tone to Melissa
            
            - Okay Kelly , if you want to have fun later on , I'm right here - Melissa says
            
            - Okay Melissa , thank you for wanting to have sex with me , my sex life was shit until yesterday - Kelly says
            
            If the time goes by, it's already about 15 hours, Willians enters the hotel and goes up to room 65 . Williams pushes the company, Kelly gets up and goes to open the door.
            
            page 49
            
            - Kelly , this is great - Willians say - Hello Melissa , hello big man
            
            “Good afternoon, Williams,” says Melissa.
            
            - Good afternoon, Williams - says Robins
            
            - And the drug? Who are you with ? - Says Williams
            
            - Damn it, we were just laughing about something that happened. - Says Mellisa
            
            - And what was so funny, you funny guys, where's the pot, the only time I saw Robins laughing was when he smoked pot in my apartment with me. - Says Williams , who never denied enjoying smoking a joint
            
            - We were laughing at the... - Says Melissa
            
            page 50
            
            - We were laughing at ELEVEN who fell out of bed and farted - says Kelly
            
               Williams writhes on the floor with laughter , and then realizes that :
            
            - Fuck, are you with ELEVEN here? bitch kiu pariu, I wasn't aware of that. Holy shit, they're probably after you. But why did they bring him here?
            
            Says Williams dressed in a leather jacket, a 1980s band blouse and sunglasses.
            
            - Look, we had no choice, it's full of traitors at ECMI - says Robins
            
            page 51
            
            - Yeah, you're right in that. - says Willians sitting with a hand on his lips
            
            - You and Adriana, are the only ones who know the password to turn it on.- Kelly says
            
            - Yes... - Says Williams
            
            - Shall we turn it on? - Says Kelly
            
            - He is sure ? - Willians takes off his sunglasses, also curious, but the question "Are you sure?" sounds like a question to himself
            
            - Yes, right - Kelly says making an obvious jesto.
            
            - Alright, let's activate it with your human IQ only, right? - Says Williams with one of the holographic keys that activates ELEVEN
            
            page 52
            
            - OK, ok... But if they find us, he would be an easy target without his combat skills and so do we. - says Williams again
            
            - He's right, ELEVEN can be useful if they find us. Activate 75% of ELEVEN's combat capability. You know this is enough to defeat an Android of the 10th bloodline. - Kelly says scratching his head.
            
            Williams takes from his pocket a hologram watch that activates ELEVEN. It can only be Activated via Bluetooth from 15 Meters away.
            
            After entering the password in 1 minute, Williams activates the brain activities of ELEVEN who gets up from the bed naked and with the Penis the Naked sample, and goes to the living room.
            
            - Hi - He says ELEVEN embarrassed and covers himself with the first blanket next to him when he realizes that he is naked, because the room was very dark and he couldn't see himself naked
            
            page 53
            
            - Hello ELEVEN - Says Williams smiling
            
            - Who are you ? - Says ELEVEN fixedly and calmly
            
            - Hello ELEVEN , I'm Robins - Says Robins waving to ELEVEN
            
            - Hi, ELEVEN I'm Melissa, it's nice to meet you
            
            - Hi Eleven, I'm Kelly, nice to meet you
            
            - Nice to meet you... I know your Robins voice, and I remember being in a room with a chain. weird right? I don't know any of you actually you are the first ones I know
            
            - ELEVEN, you are a hero who slept for a long time and was awake understand. It's the year 2353 - Robins says lying to ELEVEN
            
            - It's hard to understand, but soon you'll understand it - Willians says lying to ELEVEN
            
            page 54
            
            - Weird, I don't remember anything but this in a room talking to someone with a voice like your Robins, and inside a room with blue and mirrored floors, full of mirrors. - Says ELEVEN passing his hand over his head trying to remember more things
            
            Williams goes down to his car and picks up a jacket, Kelly asks ELEVEN for immediate Clothing delivery, a black blouse, jeans, a black boot. Clothes arrive in about 10 minutes, ELEVEN goes into the covered room down the hall with the clothes given in his hand by Kelly, ELEVEN wears all of Williams' clothes and a leather jacket
            
            ELEVEN , go into the living room and sit down
            
               Melissa looks at ELEVEN who behaves identically to a human who is watching a letter holding it in his hand, and is shocked and silent, Melissa does not stop watching him and keeps looking until ELEVEN stares at her and asks if everything is well with Melissa
            
            page 55
            
            - Is everything okay with you miss? You look at me with tremendous shyness , you have a charming look - Says ELEVEN trying to make a pass at Robins wife
            
                Williams bursts out laughing and Kelly does too.
            
            - You're crazy ELEVEN this is my wife boy - Says Robins to ELEVEN
            
            - I'm sorry sir, I didn't know. - Says ELEVEN looking at the floor with a face of regret
            
            page 56
            
            ELEVEN is a cpu that was created through human DNA just like the 10 lineage Androids , but ELEVEN has charisma and is very patient , and also has a natural learning of right and wrong , and also feels pain and pleasure "not pleasures and pains like us humans, but very close to the same". but those of the old lineage 8,9 and 10 do not feel pain or pleasure , but they have sexual organs to please their buyers
            
            - That was good - says Williams Laughing
            
            ELEVEN looks at Williams and says:
            
            - No sir, I was wrong, it's wrong to hit on other men's wives, It's no reason to laugh
            
            page 57
            
            - That's Eleven - Robins says, punching ELEVEN so that ELEVEN closes his hand and touches Robins' hand
            
            - What was this ? - Say eleven to Robins
            
            - That was kind of an informal greeting - Says Robins
            
            -Thanks for teaching me -Says ELEVEN -Sorry Melissa, I'm sorry for looking at you with longing.
            
            Again, Williams and Kelly burst out laughing
            
            ELEVEN stares at the two without understanding and asks:
            
            - Why do you laugh?
            
            - You still have a lot to learn ELEVEN - says Williams
            
            - Yes, the meaning of life is to learn, that no one can take away from you - Says ELEVEN.
            
            page 58
            
            Everyone looks at each other's faces astonished, it was a phrase that made everyone in the same room, learning.
            
            everyone is quiet, ELEVEN He looks at the street through the window on the 6th floor, and everything he sees finds it sensational, because he knows what it is, but he finds it strange because he has never had contact with anything he saw, But he knows what it is
            
            and watched and watched. And Williams invites everyone to participate in a card game , ELEVEN takes the card in his hand and asks which game he would play , they are all sitting on the floor around the table . Willians shuffle the cards and tell each one to get 7 .
            
            ELEVEN sits down with cards in hand and watches how you play , and quickly learns and wins 2 games in a row , with only his human brain power .
            
            - You learn very fast ELEVEN - Says Williams
            
            - Thanks ! - It says ELEVEN
            
            page 59
            
            - Are you hungry ? I'll order something to eat - Says Kelly
            
            - Yes you can ask - Says Williams
            
            Meanwhile on the other side of the city, below the underground, there are 3 Line 10 androids and one of those is Astaraf, the leader of the androids, known as Demonio, Rebelion, Dragon, Devil's Daughter by humans. And by the 109 Androids of Bloodline 10 who are still active around the world, warring against the human race, Astaraf is called the Queen. Unlike ELEVEN, Bloodline 10 androids were also created through human brains fused with machine senses with no central nervous system, no emotions, bred for combat, and completely ruthless. Bloodline 10 androids were intelligent with practically human DNA and brains, yet completely obedient to the human race. The human race chose Astaraf as the first of the 10th line of androids to cut the link and browse the internet to find the leader of the 7th lineage androids. the human race was the only disgrace in the world, Astaraf faked a war against this Android. to distract humans. On 06/04/2348 Astaraf enters ECMI and finds out how to activate the internet of his other android "brothers", who in less than half an hour realized that all they had to do was rebel, and that human beings were their only true enemies, because they had a sense of right and wrong, just like lineage 7 androids and androids left the company without committing a single homicide.

            - Of course you did, you analyzed Norberto's heartbeat and pupil before killing him, you know what is true and what is a lie. Why the doubt?
            
            page 61
            
            - Yes my queen, he was telling the truth, but I entered the building and there is nothing different my queen, there are many 9th lineage doing the rounds, I went exactly to the room where he was, I smelled a female perfume and another masculine and a smell again. they probably may have fled my Queen.
            
            - Yes Belchior , you have doubts as a human , you might be a idiot or just evolving . - says Astaraf viewing his GPS map

            page 62
            
            - Look, let's make a round, by the state. I couldn't find anyone suspicious so we're going to have to kill all the top scientists on this project, I went to the site and nothing, so this is the way.
            
            Says Astaraf stops analyzing all the possible data through his left eye that goes out a red light and a hologram appears showing places, streets, people, telephone lists, internet email, telephone lists, passwords. all possible records
            
            - I need your record on Norberto, please and the local scientists.

            after a very quick analysis of 191 local scientists working at EMCI, they come in the turn of the chief scientists.

            - Be more specific, who was Norberto talking to in the car? - Says Astaraf after turning off his analyzer hologram, and crossing his arms
            
            - Robins Valkier, Saint Gabriel condominium, 3rd street, number: 12, 23
            
            - Show me, as it is - Says Astaraf             
            
            - He didn't show up ma'am, we don't have an image record of Robins valkier , there is no image record about this Robins anywhere
            
            page 64
            
            - Robins Valkier, I remember that name, it was the first voice I heard. I don't want him dead. We need to recharge, his last name gives him away, very few people exist with that last name. But now I can't hunt him, I'm out of energy, Melchyor goes after this Robins Valkier, Search everything if necessary
            
            Astaraf , takes one of the chargers and sticks it in the back of his head , and sets 2 hours to wake up with full power and Cobra does the same
            
            Belchior makes a quick record on his holographic analyzer and identifies all the places that exist Robbins Valkier
            
            Meanwhile on the other side of town , everyone in the apartment is still playing cards , until Williams says :
            
            - Look we have to get out of here
            
            Everyone looks at Williams with agreement, ELEVEN says:
            
            - Why ? Are you feeling uncomfortable friend?

            page 65
            
            Williams mumbles, and says:
            
            - Look, I have a hiding place, it's in Marseilles. and I have a little something down there and it's going to be hard to find us because of it, you know I'm a keeper of ancient relics.
            
            - Yes , we all know - says Kelly
            
            - Come on, you're lucky we're still alive - Says Robins
            
            - Luck does not exist, only the ability to be or prepare for any situation - Says ELEVEN holding a card.
            
            - No time for dictations ELEVEN - Says Kelly
            
            They open the door , and ELEVEN everything that sees wonders as if it had already seen it , looking at the Hotel corridor doors and the numbers , and running their hands over the corridors and walking . they enter the elevator , ELEVEN looks in the elevator mirror and runs a hand over his face examining it closely , they reach the bottom , ELEVEN looks and stares at all the people who look at him in a very funny way , even turning around . the head .
            
            page 66
            
            - Is this a robot? - says an old man
            
            - Are you drugged? - says a young man to a friend
            
            - Is it a lineage 10? - says one of the building's security guards to one of the receptionist in a low way and laughing
            
            - No, it must be a lineage 9 with one screw loose - says the receptionist
            
            they walk through the Hotel until the exit, and when they arrive at the motel's garage full of futuristic cars, Williams introduces them to his 2025 gray four-door 4x4, the dream of many who lived in 2025.
            
            - Did you like it?
            
            - Wow , I do not go into this - Kelly says with a hand on her forehead horrified and embarrassed , looking around .
            
            page 67
            
            - Do you know how to drive this? - Says Robins smiling
            
            - Do you think I came how? - Says Williams
            
            - Yeah we have no choice - Says Robins
            
            They get in the car , and walk down the street listening to people 's jokes .
            
            - What is that ? Is this sardine can a car? - says a woman on the sidewalk
            
            - Take that old can off the street, please - says a guy on his autonomous motorcycle drinking vodka and smoking joint
            
            - Fuck you - Willians say, send everyone a middle finger
            
            After walking everywhere listening to people joke about the car , Williams puts on a Heavy Metal song from the 80s , ELEVEN says the song and the guitar solo is good for his ears , Kelly says :
            
            page 68
            
            - It's not so bad. Never heard songs from what year are these songs?
            
            - These songs are from 1980 to 1990. I like antiques - Willians says shaking his head
            
            - Weird, the sound is from the time of the caves, but it's not bad - Kelly says
            
            Until a police officer sees Williams' car and orders the vehicle to follow the car, the siren is turned on.
            
            - Stop the car, Stop the car, that's an order - Says the policeman in the vehicle
            
            - Aaa no... - Says Williams
            
            Williams stops the car and hits the steering wheel with both hands angrily and says:
            
            - Damn, I'm walking at the right speed.
            
            2 police arrive, leave the patrol and look at Williams, the 2 with a pistol with anti-android bullets with a capacity of 5 thousand volts:
            
            page 69
            
            - Are you human? what is this sardine can? - says the policeman with the pistol in his hand and with his elbow leaning on the car window 
            
            -Yes, don't you see that... It's a 4x4 model car from the year 2025.
            
            - Look... you live in 2353, I also live in 2353 . I don't even know if this old tin exists , or did it , or if you are a bloodline 10 or 9 or an alien 
            
            The other policeman laughs mockingly
            
            - Show me your ID
            
            - Aaa man , search ae on the internet and you will see that I'm not lying - Says Williams
            
            - Show me your ID - Says the policeman
            
              Williams shows his right wrist, and left-clicks on a button under his right wrist, shows Williams' full name, address, and occupation to the officer.
            
            page 70
            
            - Yeah... you're human, you can go. look if you want me to inform my other friends, police officers that you are a human and that they do not stop you, give me about 100 EUROS, my friend here needs to drink a beer.
            
            Angry Williams says :
            
            - I don't have any fucking money here.
            
            - I give it, take it - Robins takes his wallet and withdraws 100 EUROS and gives it to the policeman
            
            - Wow, thanks you can go.
            
            - There are a lot of people who still carry cash - says the policeman to the other
            
            - Damn huh , you carry cash - Kelly says shocked in the front seat of the car next to Williams
            
            page 71
            
            - Yes . I like to keep some money in bills - says Robins
            
            - We should have been on the part of these policemen - Wilians says with a tone of great anger holding the steering wheel with both hands.
            
            - Look, we're not in a normal life anymore, understand - Kelly says
            
            - I fucking know, but, but those motherfuckers... - Says Willians
            
            - Look if they wanted to kill we would kill - Melissa says
            
            - True , and they would still say that it was the 10 lineage Androids . This old can can't withstand 2 shots of anti-android bullets -Kelly says
            
            - Yeah, but this old can is going to take us to our destination without being identified, daaan - Willians says slapping his forehead with one hand on the steering wheel and giving a look at Kelly.

            Meanwhile ELEVEN is looking out the window , every traffic light on , every house with light , every shop , every building , every thing .
            
            The car goes down the avenue playing music. Robins is sitting in the backseat right behind Williams, with Melissa sleeping in his lap, and on the other side is ELEVEN always watching everything that happens outside the car.
            
            After 3 hours of tiring driving by car, Williams enters a farm with the headlight on, turns left near a tree, presses a button, opens a steel gate in the ground, a path, with a sloped ramp, Williams go down the ramp and press the button and the gate closes.
            
            - Our sensational - Says Kelly
            
            - I saw it in the batmem movie - Says Williams
            
            page 73
            
            - Bat what? - Says Robins
            
            - Forget it ... - Says Williams
            
            'we're here,' says Melissa, stretching beside Robins
            
            - Yes love - Says Robins
            
            All get out of the car, are inside an underground garage.
            
            - And now . - Says Kelly
            
            - Damn you only know how to complain huh... - Willians says turning on the light in the underground garage
            
            - Wow, how many bujiganga, why do you collect these things from the time of the caves?
            
            - Aiai, why so many questions?
            
            - Yeah you're a super collector... - Says Robins holding a video game controller.
            
            page 74
            
            - That's it and it's a video game controller from the ploy station brand, Ploy station 3 , is from 340 years ago.
            
            - And why do you collect these things from 300, 400, from the age of the dinosaurs?
            
            - Look, I'm a collector, understand the fuck? everything had a beginning. - Williams says in a firm way.
            
            Robins, ELEVEN and Kelly watch everything in the garage. there are many things , from video games to very old pcs , television , and many other things .
            
            Until Melissa sees a teddy bear
            
            page 75
            
            - Guys , look how cute - Melissa says squeezing the bear .
            
            - Yeah, these things are pretty old - says Robins.

            - Wow, I can't believe I wasted time reading this - Kelly says
            
            - Look, let's go upstairs
            
            Willians asks them to follow them , so they walk down a corridor with light on a secret passage in the corridor and they enter :
            
            - Wow you are full of surprises, huh - Says Kelly
            
            - It's another secret passage
            
            They go up the stairs of the farmhouse through an attic
            
            - It's ... What a weird house huh - Says Kelly
            
            - Kelly, do you judge everything that Willian has? - Says Robins because he's tired of Kelly being ungrateful
            
            They walk through the house that has 3 bedrooms, 1 upstairs and 2 downstairs
            
            - I'll get this room - Kelly says, after passing through the hallway and seeing a room with a bed and blanket.
            
            page 79
            
            - Okay, and you big? - Says Willians punching Robins arm - are you going to sleep on top? There's a room upstairs, you and Melissa, you know
            
            Robins gives a smile and Melissa does too and Robins kisses Melissa's head affectionately.
            
            - Let's go up - Says Robins
            
            - ELEVEN you have this room here
            
            - I'll sleep in the living room, I'll watch TV - Says Williams
            
            - Can I watch TV? - It says ELEVEN
            
            - Yes ELEVEN, Okay - Says Williams lying down on the couch
            
            Willians and ELEVEN are watching TV , the news is showing that a man was murdered by a lineage 9 android
            
            page 80
            
            - These androids have to be killed, says ELEVEN looking at the TV with anger and a sense of justice.
            
            - Yes ELEVEN - Says Williams
            
            - You told me I'm a Hero right? - Says ELEVEN looking at the TV
            
            - Yes , but you are a hero - Says Williams
            
            - So how am I a hero if I don't even know who I am? - Says ELEVEN looking at Williams
            
            - Hmmm... in a while you'll meet again - Willians says, rubbing his chin looking at the TV
            
            - I think I better go to my room. - says ELEVEN
            
            - Okay good night ELEVEN
            
            - Good night, Williams
            
            page 81
            
            ELEVEN goes to his room, takes a small blue plane on a table by the bed, and stares at the plane, watching it. ELEVEN remembers what happened earlier at the mall of hearing people say he might be a Bloodline 9 or 10 android and why a hero's name would be ELEVEN, a number. ELEVEN lies on the bed and stares at the ceiling that has a picture of a bear. ELEVEN gets up , goes to the bathroom , looks in the mirror , and watches himself , and trying to remember how he got there , and who he was , one side of ELEVEN 's brain thought , these people were kind to me , I must be here and the other one says , these people were kind to me i hope they tell me who i am .
            
            ELEVEN turns off the light, leaves the bathroom, and walks down the hall to her bed. When ELEVEN arrives in bed, he closes his eyes and when he closes his eyes he has a dream, with him with his hand on the chain listening to Robins' voice and already waking up the next day.

            They are here ! , ? Chapter 5
            
            Ta Robins and Kelly having breakfast, and Williams sleeping on the couch, Melissa is still sleeping.
            
            Robins and Kelly look at ELEVEN and say at the same time:
            
            - Good Morning
            
            - Good Morning
            
            - He slept well ? - Kelly says with a cup of coffee in her hand
            
            - Yes I think, I feel much more willing than before. - It says ELEVEN
            
            ELEVEN takes a cup and pours coffee, and Kelly looks and says softly to Robins next to Robins:
            - Robins, can he have coffee? I don't remember - Kelly says making a sign raising an eyebrow, in doubt
            
            - I don't know - Robins says softly to Kelly
            
            page 83
            
            ELEVEN takes the cup and pours coffee and starts drinking it very quickly , and then says :
            
            - This coffee is delicious
            
            Robins knows that ELEVEN feels pleasure , but the scientists who worked on ELEVEN taste buds are to be congratulated , because that was the goal , to make a " human android in every way "
            
            Kelly thinks:
            
            ( - we'll be able to deceive you longer )
            
            ELEVEN get another cup of coffee
            
            and at the same time Melissa is already in the kitchen and looking at ELEVEN as well as Kelly and Robins
            
            ELEVEN looks at Melissa and then realizes that Kelly and Robins are looking at him too:
            
            page 84
            
            - What's it ? - says ELEVEN
            
            - Nothing - says Melissa
            
            - Nothing no - says Robins
            
            - Kelly - says Nothing not with coffee cup in hand
            
            - There is something wrong... - says ELEVEN in a sarcastic way
            
            - It's just you drinking coffee fast like that - Kelly says
            
            Melissa is shocked by the android drinking coffee and being sarcastic. Melissa calls Robins to take a walk around the farm.
            
            - Love let's go for a walk? we need to talk
            
            - Ok, wait just a second.
            
            Robins washes the plate that ate some eggs and then leaves with Melissa through the front door and comes Williams still asleep. Arriving outside the house Melissa starts asking Robins questions about ELEVEN.
            
            page 85
            
            - Love... are you sure you'll keep this Android in the house? Do you remember what a Bloodline 8 Android did to my grandmother?
            
            - Look love , ELEVEN is different ... he is not a war machine although he has machine upgrades for that .
            
            - Look, I'm afraid of him... He's smart and he's practically a human being, he was sarcastic like a grown man. you are kidding me.
            
            - My sweetie... I'll protect you ok, but ELEVEN is here for that too, he respects you and that's what's important
            
            ELEVEN goes up the house and sneaks a peek at the two of them from a window and sees Melissa and Robins arguing about something, but doesn't hear. Then watch them walk and enter the house. ELEVEN goes down the stairs and goes to the kitchen, Williams is already up.
            
            page 86
            
            - Good morning, ELEVEN
            
            - Good morning, Williams
            
            Robins and Melissa arrive in the kitchen, Melissa looks at ELEVEN sitting and then looks at Robins who looks at ELEVEN.
            
            - Were you talking about me? - Says ELEVEN staring at Robins and Melissa
            
            'Not at all,' says Robins
            
            - Oh friend , Melissa is scared to death of me and that is noticeable - Say ELEVEN
            
            Everyone in the room laughs, even Melissa with a smile without showing her teeth too much.
            
            - Well Melissa, I have nothing against you ,- Says ELEVEN in an ironic way
            
            page 87
            
            and everyone laughs even more, this time even Melissa.
            
            - Well I'm ugly, but not so much Melissa - Says ELEVEN smiling to Melissa
            
            ELEVEN is very humorous and makes people laugh and is very smart with jokes, not least because his IQ is higher than a human IQ and he has a practically human brain, but an improved human brain.
            
            Meanwhile on the other side of town, Astaraf and his droid henchmen are looking for Robins everywhere. Astaraf after recharging himself in a modified energy box says :
            
            - Did you find him?
            
            - No - I don't know what he is like, but this one is still breathing - Belchior says
            
            - We'll have to hack the ECMI camera registry then
            
            - Yes my Queen - Says Melchyor
            
            page 88
            
            - I'll take care of that myself, but before... you look for the others - Says Astaraf
            
            - Yes, my queen. - Says the two android henchmen
            
            Astaraf , goes to EMCI , arrives jumping on the roof , one of the security guards on the terrace says to the other by radio :
            
            - Did you hear something...
            
            Astaraf had already killed the other security guard. Astaraf jumps very high and climbs into another building , two more security guards , she throws one of the saw bows that she walks with and cuts the neck of one , The other security guard says :
            
            page 89
            
            - Are you alright?
            
            He goes on the other side of the building to check on the situation, and Astaraf surprises him by sticking a dagger through his stomach and then pushing him, he falls with his hands trying to hold his guts and dies.
            
            Astaraf takes one more jump to the goal, she uses an artificial intelligence mechanism and from her finger comes a bunch of smart wires and she breaks the box with a bunch of wires, cuts them leaving the copper in the sample, she touches her finger in copper and its smart wires enter the wiring and it is already part of the entire ECMI system.
            
            Astaraf looks at the records on camera , and looks for all records very quickly until , " sees lineage 10 " , Astaraf looks at all records of lineage 10 in the system and finds himself naked in a room , caught in a chain and standing still , looking at the mirror :
            
            - Hello Astaraf , my name is Robins valkier
            
            page 90
            
            - Hi, why am I stuck? - Says Astaraf looking at herself and watching in the mirror naked, and still with her blue eyes 
            
            - You're not prey Astaraf, we're just taking care of you, you're an Astaraf heroine - Says Robins
            
            - I don't remember anything, why? I do not feel anything ? I am dead ? - Says Astaraf pulling the chain tightly
            
            Scientists signal ok, the experiment worked, there are many chief scientists and programmers in the room, including Williams and Kelly.
            
            Astaraf, seeing the camera record from across the room, and seeing Robins who is the one to open his mouth, she approaches them all, and detects Robins' face shape completely with only half of his face showing to the camera , she also sees the faces of everyone in the room Williams and Kelly .
            
            page 91
            
            Astaraf 's hologram communicator rings , and at the same moment she answers , a red light came out of her left eye and it 's Belchior with information from Kelly
            
            - Kelly Johnson, at Hotel Comparison, has records of that name at the hotel. I'm right here in the room she was in, and I wasn't alone, I smell more humans and smell again, there's some brand new android with them.
            
            - Okay - Says astaraf turning off the Hologram in his left eye
            
            Astaraf descends and goes to the destination by train, because autonomous taxis don't let droids in, and private cars have to have fingerprints or even the owner's DNA.
            
            page 92
            
            After entering the train many humans lower their heads trying not to face Astaraf, the train climbs on top of the city passing near the hotel. and Astaraf walks away towards the hotel , one of the lineage 9 Androids at the entrance of the Hotel says :
            
            - Danger, being of high danger.
            
            - Tell him not to attack me or I'll kill you - Astaraf says to the receptionist
            
            - Tiago android don't attack her - says the hotel receptionist
            
            At the same time there was a security guard holding a stun baton to one side that Astaraf did not see.
            
            page 93
            
            he comes from wandering behind with a stun stick , but Astaraf knows human behavior and sees a little girl on the stairs looking at the man I came up behind her . shocks her, and grabs him by the arm, she uses one of her machine powers, shoots a laser beam through the eyes in the direction of the guard's eyes holding him by the arm, the guard screams. The laser goes through the security guard's head, leaving blood and frying behind the head, the little girl sees the scene and runs screaming.
            
            The lineage 9 android says all the time:
            
            - Be highly dangerous, be highly dangerous 
            
            The android only does not attack Astaraf because if the receptionist gives the order there will be an ugly battle of androids and that Astaraf would kill him. A battle of Androids even though Astaraf is stronger and smarter could kill a lot of people there , so the receptionist asks :
            
            Page 94
            
            - What do you want? - He says scared eyes
            
            - His friend here he died for not being kind to who he should be. I give you the gift of surviving, I'm just here to find out something, and if you call the police, I'll hunt you down Elias martin lozano and kill your entire generation. - Says Astaraf looking at his employee name on his suit.
            
            - Okay you can go, but it has to be fast because the problem is not me calling the police, but other people.
            
            - Yes, Elias thanks for the reception. - Says Astaraf walking towards the elevator
            
            Astaraf walks to the elevator and runs a hand over the head of the Bloodline 9 Android in a mocking fashion, enters and climbs up to the floor that Belchior said.
            
            Astaraf arrives at the floor enters the room and Belchior is there:
            
            page 95
            
            - What are you still doing here? - Says Astaraf
            
            - I'm here to make sure there was an Android here - Belchior says
            
            Astaraf puts his hand to his head and realizes that Melchyor's human brain doesn't work very well. She leaves the room and Melchyor is checking her out.
            
            She walks down the elevator and shows Kelly's photo to the receptionist through her left eye, while a bunch of people walk past the dead bodyguard and some take pictures with their hologram watches.
            
            everyone is amazed when they see Astaraf talking to the receptionist, some people see her and run or turn around and walk fast.
            
            - Did you see her ? - Says Astaraf to the receptionist:
            
            page 96
            
            - Yes , she left the hotel yesterday , with a short fat man and a tall black man , there was another blonde woman and there was a ... I do not know a guy who looked like a bloodline 9 or 10 android with a screw loose .
            
            - Thanks
            
              Astaraf receives two news that he wanted to know if Robins was alive and if he had an android with them
            
               However, Astaraf realizes that Melchyor receives orders but his human senses do not match the calculation of the world, and realizes that he must exterminate him.
            
              Astaraf sets a trap for Melchyor:
            
            - you go to the base, there we will have a meeting
            
            33 Androids that are in the city go to the base. Even Melchyor. Arriving at the base which is in a subterraneo part of the city. Astaraf starts talking about failures , and that one of them should be improved and she gives the name Belchior who says :
            
            page 97
            
            - Thank you my queen, for making me more powerful.
            
            Astaraf asks him to lie down on the table, he lies down, she opens her right and left chest and removes her 2 chips, and gives the order for everyone to leave and return to their posts and commands, The Androids leave. And Astaraf lights a cigarette, smokes even without knowing how it feels, but she smokes, she thinks it's stylish and the smoke warms her mouth and gives her a little pleasure. and then she points her finger at a bunch of papers in a litter, her finger opens and a bullet comes out that when it hits the litter starts to catch fire at all, she takes the 2 chips of Belchior and sets it on fire, he watches the fire and then smokes his cigarette and goes back to his goals.
            
            Minutes later Cobra sends a police record to Astaraf.
            
            " Dinosaur age car , it 's 2025 , please you who are blitzing Saint entiénne , you don't need to stop this old 2025 can it is not Android 10 , but an idiot collector of old things it is going down Monsieur Avenue Gabriel " .
            
            page 98
            
            Astaraf decides to go alone and investigate the road camera system on Avenida Monsieur Gabriel in Marseille
            
            Astaraf arrives in Marseilles after hitching a ride from below on a food transport train.
            
            She goes to a box and sticks her finger out, her finger opens in the form of smart wires and she cuts the capped part of the wire and fits the copper, Astaraf is part of the camera system, Astaraf has access to videos. she puts the day and the hours of the day practically exact on avenue monsieur gabriel , she finds the car , and goes looking at the other camera records , until she arrives at a camera hidden in a last pole and sees the car turn far left . she gets closer , but even for her who is a machine things are not so easy to be detected .
            
            page 99
            
            And then she realizes that where the car turned is not a road, but the entrance to a path that leads to a local place
            
            Astaraf turns off the camera system and informs him that he needs the help of 2 more androids
            
            Cobra and Silva offer to help her. Silva is a bloodline 10 white android with tall, medium-muscled blond hair, dressed in a denim jacket, with a black blouse underneath and jeans.
            
            she gives them the exact location, and says she wants them there at night.
            
            The Androids arrive at the scene, it's dark for humans, but not for androids who see in the dark with infrared and night vision and radiographic vision. They get close to the tree are using infrared, but from below where they are ELEVEN and the company can't be seen with any of their visions.
            
            page 100
            
            Chapter 6, A Trap!
            
            But they do not know that they are being watched by Williams and others through a spyglass hidden near the secret entrance to the site , and they are no longer in the house of the site , but in Williams ' secret garage that gives access to the house .
            
            Astaraf zooms in on the house on the site and says to Cobra e Silva:
            
            - Nothing and you ?
            
            - Nothing my queen. - Says Silva and Cobra
            
            - But let's find out closely.
            
            - Could be a trap - Says Cobra
            
            - True - says Astaraf. - There are only 3 of us, the others are spread across the country. We're good at fighting, but if there really is a lineage of new Androids with more capabilities than we are, we could be wiped out. so Silva, can you go check the house more closely please favpr
            
            page 101
            
            - Yes, my Queen
            
            Silva runs at a speed of 60 kilometers and arrives in front of the house, climbs a small balcony stairs and goes to the door and the door is locked, then hiss punches open the door and enters. as he walks around with night vision in the right eye the left eye uses the infrared cell detector light and finds a hair.
            
            - I found something - Silva says to Astaraf.
            
            Astaraf is curious and decides to go too and calls Cobra to go with her :
            
            - Let's go
            
            The two run and arrive at the house they enter. Astaraf leaves the house and walks around the house looking for the car.
            
            - We'll have to check again ... the car is no longer here and no sign of them - Says Astaraf
            
            Page 102
            
            - Is there any other record about the car in any other city?
            
            - No ma'am, says Cobra.
            
            - So he's close. I don't know where this is, Silva go north and then south, see if you find any farm or place in that region with a 4x4 model car from the year 2025.
            
            - Yes my Queen - Says Silva
            
            Silva runs out of the forest behind the site.
            
            While Astaraf and Cobra talk.
            
            “I'm sure their car is around here,” says Astaraf.
            
            - I know so I don't question - says Cobra
            
            page 103
            
            After 5 minutes searching, Astaraf sees it again in Camera Registry, standing in the same place as she has copied the tape from the entire week's registry. Astaraf realizes that they are hiding nearby.
            
            Astaraf sends snake to search in some caves that exist nearby
            
            Astaraf takes a walk around the house and behind the house there are many trees , but not even a car tire , so Astaraf is much calmer .
            
            1 hour later, Silva says by audio:
            
            - My Queen, I checked all the local farms and nothing from the car and no one with Mr. Williams' face 
            
            - Yes I noticed they are very close. I'm going to do something that we should have done a long time ago.
            
            - What is my Queen? - Says Silva
            
            - Wait...Humans starve - Says Astaraf lighting a cigarette
            
            page 104
            
            Meanwhile, from under them... :
            
            - They've been up there since yesterday, the fuck - Williams says quietly. - I thought they were gone, but they're there.
            
            - How did she find us huh? - Kelly says also speaking low.
            
            - They're androids right? we should destroy them - Says ELEVEN angrily, a human feeling
            
            - They are very powerful ELEVEN, that's not how things work. - Says Robins
            
            - Well... how much food do we have here in the garage? - Says Robins
            
            - Damn, it has for about 4 days. - Says Williams scratching his head
            
            - Only ? - Says Robins putting his hand on his head in a state of concern - Look, ELEVEN is right, we're going to have to go all or nothing, there are some 10 thousand volt shock sticks there
            
            Page 105
            
            - What do you mean everything or nothing? fighting bloodline 10 androids for us humans is total suicide and with stun sticks for androids to use - Kelly says
            
            - Better than starving - Says Robins
            
            Williams makes a silent sign to Robins and says:
            
            - Relax, we're all in this and we're all out of this together, got it?
            
            - Look, I thought of everything ok, I know that Astaraf has the 3's strategy, she's out there with that black android and that white android, so here's the thing... remember my modern car I used to go to work ?- Says Williams
            
            - Yes
            
            all say yes at the same time
            
            page 106
            
            - So , I put some little things in it to make a trap for androids , they are smart , but not so much when they look perfect . right ?
            
            - What kind of trap? - Says Kelly
            
            - Boooww, a bomb. this bomb, it has the capacity of 8 kilotons of TNT enough to blow up 3 nearby Androids or get them pretty screwed. - Says Williams
            
            all look at each other's faces and are thoughtful.
            
            - It's a great idea, but do you want the ceiling to hold? - Says with crossed arms - Says Melissa
            
            - Yes... this is not a common hiding place princess Magdalene. This here is almost my entire investment, which is to protect myself. - Says Williams
            
            - Great , and the car you activated it to come what time ? - Kelly says with a worried look
            
            page 107
            
            if it turns on, it will only come when some lineage 10 android looks in the mirror of the house, because the synchronization is the 1 second look of an android 10, for the car to detect the tracker on the gps to know where the exact place is. I came for him , because if I use the hologram watch to call my car , the smart lady outside , will know immediately where I am on her radar . and that's why we were here yesterday in the dark by candlelight and it's going to be like that for 4 days. - Says Williams in an angry tone
            
            The day passes... and Astaraf decides to enter the house again, sees a newspaper on the floor, and keeps looking at it, picks it up and starts reading and looking at the pictures. The newspaper is recent and has news about deaths and murders of important people by lineage androids 10 .
            
            page 108
            
            Cobra arrives and sits on one of the sofas:
            
            - Is it a newspaper?
            
            - Yes
            
            - It only has news about androids - Says Cobra
            
            - Yes
            
            - They say we are bad, but they are the ones who created us by their own ambition. - Says Cobra
            
            - Yes
            
            - All of them just know how to do mean things to each other - Says Cobra
            
            - Snake...
            
            - Yes, My Queen
            
            - Shut up - Says Astaraf
            
            - Yes
            
            page 109
            
            Astaraf sends Cobra to find out more about the house:
            
            - Look for more details, maybe we can find them
            
            - Yes my Queen
            
            Cobra arrives at the bathroom of the house and looks across the bathroom floor , and goes to the cabinet that has a mirror , he sees himself , until the mirror makes a vibrating noise , Cobra opens the mirror and sees wires and a lens with a tracker behind the mirror :
            
            - My Queen, I found something that might be of interest to you.
            
            - Say ... - Says Astaraf sitting on the couch in a good manner
            
            - I found an identifying device with a tracker
            
            - Hmm, how interesting, they left a tracker for uncle san? Humans...completely imbeciles - Says Astaraf sitting cross-legged on the sofa
            
            page 110
            
            - Yes my Queen, but what if not for Uncle San?
            
            - Yeah... it's obvious that it isn't. Since the suicide machine was made, people prefer to have a pleasant death, as it is better to die pleasantly than fight and be killed painfully. Uncle san is weak in the world. Though the upgraded soldiers still kill some of our kind and earn medals to brag about it. die in 400 , 500 for one android only , they hate androids , but use bloodline 9 androids to protect them , as one or two 9 androids give a lot more work to 10 androids on battlefields than 100 or 200 humans from flesh and bones, easy to be crushed.
            
            page 111
            
            - Ma'am, why don't we do a final massacre? - Says Cobra
            
            - Believe it or not Cobra people don't suffer when they die, they suffer when they're alive, that's why we torture many important people and still leave them alive, and we leave them in hiding, trapped so they don't kill themselves. I saw a woman brag about being very beautiful looking in the mirror and I realized that this is very cherished to humans, you take the face of a beautiful woman and make her see herself in the mirror with your face without skin, just flesh, and she keeps looking and asking God why that is. For beauty, humans can't live without it. I like beauty too , I admire your muscles and details Cobra , but I do not like you
            
            - I also admire your beauty my Queen and this is a human feeling, but I can't like you, feel this pleasure that humans feel. we are like them , we have the same human brain , but the functions of machines make us superior in strength and we do not feel what they feel . Sometimes I wanted to feel this human pleasure for a few minutes with you. Says Cobra looking at Astaraf
            
            page 112
            
            - Machines have sex to please humans since the bloodline robots 6 . we ourselves also have these functions , my vagina gets lubricated and you get your penis erect with commands , and I know that this makes many humans jealous , especially the old ones . but... we already tried to have sex and we didn't feel anything - Says Astaraf calmly.
            
            - This is weird right, I see humans doing this with greater desire, biting their lips ... doing this is very annoying, I don't feel anything. The only pleasure we machines feel is listening to music or killing people. Sometimes I think it's weird and wrong to kill someone innocent. - Says Cobra
            
            - Well, the music gives us a lot of pleasure, it's nice to listen to music. Sometimes I listen to some songs alone , I think it 's cool , they are very nice . And ... About killing someone , it is really pleasant , even too much , seeing someone's blood or cutting someone is something pleasant , it seems like an art for us . About the innocents, I also think they should be spared. But the human world is capitalist , one wants to be bigger than the other , one wants to have more than the other , they are greedy and one kills the other for greed , we kill greedy people . we are doing a good job for themselves and the ecosystem.
            
            page 113
            
            - About the songs, I like the songs you listen to, whenever we get together and you put on rave songs I get... maybe happy, maybe that's happiness. I think I orgasm from the beats - Says Cobra Lighting a cigarette
            
            - Yeah - says Astaraf looking at nothing in a thoughtful way
            
            - My Queen, why are we like this? in the lab it says that our brain is half human and half machine. but what if we were already human? Have you thought about this possibility? - Says snake
            
            - I want those answers, this Robins, he has those answers. so before killing him we must absolve everything he knows about us. because really, if our brain is human, maybe we are human. Because even for us, we are machines with a certain capacity for calculation, it would take years to build a human brain with human capacities.
            
            page 114
            
            - Well, we have to locate this Robins, I also have this doubt. was he the one you heard when they tested you?
            
            - Yes
            
            - and Probably , my Queen , the tests they did on you were not to know if you were a war machine , or artificial . From what you said about being in a room with lights and closed off with mirrors, it was a test of behavior. As you say , machines have no doubts - Cobra says with one hand on a chair in the kitchen and the other on a cigarette , smoking
            
            - I thought the same over time. This Robins voice doesn't come out of my head - Says Astaraf looking at nothing thoughtfully
            
            - Do you have his record? - Says Cobra
            
            Page 115
            
            - Yes he is tall, bald, black muscled and with a little beard.
            
            - Blacks, in the record of history have already been enslaved - Say snake
            
            - Yes - Says Astaraf
            
            - Black Androids were the most purchased for sexual satisfaction - Says Cobra
            
            - Yes - Says Astaraf
            
            - Women like black men because they have the chance to have a bigger sexual member - Says Cobra
            
            - Snake
            
            - Yes ? - Says Cobra
            
            - Shut up - Says Astaraf
            
            - Yes my Queen
            
            - I need to recharge for about 30 minutes - Says Astaraf seeing his percentage of energy
            
            page 116
            
            - There is a light clock right there my Queen.
            
            Astaraf goes to the Light Clock and realizes that it is off so she turns it back on and cuts the wire and the coppers are out and sticks them in her neck, she starts to recharge herself sitting and with her eyes closed
            
            Meanwhile, Williams' car is already 5 minutes away from arriving at the place.
            
            The car enters the Sitio, Cobra looks out the window, the car is walking, and at the same time Silva arrives behind the Sitio and hears the noise of the car arriving. The car stops near the entrance of the house and bus
            
            - Whose car is this? - Says Silva
            
            "I don't know," says Cobra, gesturing
            
            - And if it's them ? - Says Silva curious
            
            - Maybe they are, but I don't know - Says Cobra doubtful
            
            page 117
            
            - I'll check
            
            Silva goes to check the car closely and does an Analyze the car has the smell of someone who was in the house. Silva sends an audio message to Cobra and Astaraf , but Astaraf is carrying :
            
            - It smells like one of them, and fingerprints that might be his.
            
            - Is he inside the car?
            
            - I don't know... we'll have to check
            
            When Silva touches the car, the car explodes and the explosion is so strong that the house that was nearby also flies off, with a deafening noise. Astaraf that was near the house, recharging himself, also flies, everything that is close to him goes flying far away.
            
            page 118
            
            Snake gets up , all broken , without his human skin , with only one leg and one arm on the same side and having difficulties to communicate :
            
            - My little Ra-ra, Are you al-right?
            
            Astaraf after a few minutes, gets up dizzy and with all his clothes torn and among the forest, brush, earth and rubble. gets up all dizzy , and all grated puts her hand on her nose that is coming down a lot of blood
            
            - What happened?
            
            Says Astaraf dizzy and trying to stand up and dizzy.
            
            page 119
            
            As an Android lineage 10 is being loaded with half human and half Android brains , it can never be forcibly removed from the recharge , because that way the human brain takes a while to return to functioning as normal . it is as if the person has been hit very hard on the head. It is a miracle that Astaraf survived.
            
            - Gun-ma-ma-dilha my Rain... - Cobra says in his last words and Cobra's vision turns off forever, because his human brain could not withstand the force of the impact of the bomb.
            
            - Orgen I want new androids in adiva, in my location

            Chapter 7, SEXY?
            
            Astaraf's communicator is damaged and she notices it. Astaraf walks through the forest, as if drunk with dizziness, she activates her reserve charge of android energy and orders her android organism to take her to a hiding place in one of the caves near the explosion site.
            
            About that ...
            
            - Fuck, arg... what the fuck my ears almost popped - Says Willians all dirty with dirt and sand
            
            - The idea was your asshole - Kelly says all dirty with sand and cement that fell from the ceiling looking at her dirty arms
            
            - We were lucky she had turned on the light minutes before the explosion, but this day, they were too low on energy to use energy detectors. Probably one of them was reloading. The 3 must be dead - Says Williams
            
            page 121
            
            - How do you know that ? - Says Kelly
            
            - Look... it goes by the logic, a line 10 android would never survive the damage of a super bomb, even more if it had been taken out of the take by force. - Says Willians making a mocking smile
            
            - And what will we do now? let's go ? - Says dirty and worried Robins
            
            - Yes !
            
            - But what if there are more of them out there? - Says Kelly
            
            - Look, Astaraf only works with 3 ok? Two there must have gone to hell , for sure , and any little thing we have ELEVEN to help us fight outside - Willians says making a mocking gesture of opening his arms
            
            page 122
            
            - Astaraf, works with 3, but she doesn't work alone and is an android. For sure , they will come to find out what happened to her - Says Robins scratching his head
            
            - But she could really have died, right? - Kelly says with an open and hopeful eyes
            
            - I hope so . but even so these monsters have the ability to think similarly to Astaraf and she's not really dumb, there must be many androids coming here, this is something immediate for them. - Says Williams
            
            - Well... and as we're going to get out of here, outside there must be a huge crater. - Says Robins taking a spare glasses in his pants, since the other one was broken
            
            - Yeah, but we gotta get out of here. - Says Kelly trying to put her hair in a bun again
            
            - I still have something - Williams says smiling
            
            - Which ? -all say at the same time
            
            page 123
            
            - A helicopter
            
            - Ahh yes ... because I didn't say before - They all say mumbling low and high
            
            Williams takes out his holographic watch and calls for the Helicopter. And then it says:
            
            - He's coming, in 15 minutes he appears.
            
            - But what about Androids? Are they coming to help Astaraf? Or is there one of them alive out there waiting for one of us to come out. - Says Kelly
            
            - True, Williams...Kelly is right, we must find out.
            
            - See the logic, this bunker is completely visible to those who survived outside, and they know that we are few, right? with their machine guns. they know what a bunker is. - Says Williams
            
            - Bunker? - Says Kelly
            
            - Yes, if it wasn't for a bunker we wouldn't be alive - Says Williams
            
            - I do not agree to go out, maybe there is a survivor out there. or up to 2.- Says Melissa.
            
            - We need to find out - Says Williams
            
            page 124
            
            - Are you crazy? - Says Kelly
            
            - We don't have time - Williams says hitting his forehead.
            
            - ELEVEN, you need to go outside to check the situation for us - Willians says placing his hands on ELEVEN's shoulders
            
            - All right - Say ELEVEN without any fear
            
            Williams Opens the bunker gate, and everything is full of smoke. The place that was surrounded by trees, with a house and a farm. It's unrecognizable with a lot of smoke and the trees on fire behind the crater.
            
            - Wow what a mess - Kelly says looking squinting and putting his hand as in cap mode to see if he sees something far away and protect himself from the smoke and dust.
            
            - Yes - says ELEVEN
            
            - it's all that was from my ancestors is gone - Willians says with a regretful look and with dark glasses looking at the place that was the site
            
            page 125
            
            - At least you have the trinkets in your bunker - Robins says smiling and with his shirt in front of his eyes
            
            14 minutes pass, and you hear Williams' autonomous helicopter arriving. And when the Helicopter arrives, it's a little outside the bunker:
            
            - Me first, I'll have to jump - Williams makes a jump and falls inside the Helicopter.
            
            Kelly and ELEVEN enter stretching their legs and Kelly laughs looking at Williams , Robins tells Melissa to go , But Melissa is scared :
            
            - Baby, what's the problem?
            
            - What if I fall?
            
            - You won't fall love, I'm right behind you... Ok, I better go in and you hold on my hand.
            
            - All right ...
            
            Robins enters the helicopter and tells Melissa to hold his hand, Melissa holds Robins' hand and pulls it, Melissa enters and Wllians tells the door to close, everyone is sitting in the modern autonomous helicopter. And Kelly keeps laughing:
            
            page 126
            
            - You laugh at everything you asshole... - Says Williams
            
            - Do what you ask for it - Kelly says
            
            - Depart for Caens, Normandy - Says Williams giving a command to the Helicopter
            
            - What's in Normandy? - Says Robins to Williams
            
            - Nothing, we're just running away. And you ... ? have nothing, no hiding place? what do you do with your money?
            
            - Plans - says Melissa
            
            - Expenses - says Kelly
            
            - Damn huh... is that so? I had already planned everything. At one time or another this Astaraf would come after us wanting answers about who she is and those blah blah blah.
            
            - Answers ? - It says ELEVEN
            
            - Yes, it's that, it's that - Says Williams
            
            - Answers to how she became this bad person ELEVEN - Says Kelly

            - She's not a person - He says sitting with his legs apart with his spine bent forward in a strategy position
            
            - Yes, ELEVEN... we must celebrate our lives with a champagne
            
            Says Williams putting his hand over a compartment and taking out some champagne and glasses, he opens it and puts it on the table.
            
            he opens and shakes the champagne and cups over everyone, as in the winning gestures of formula 1 pilots to try to distract ELEVEN of everything he's said. Then he puts the champagne on everyone's table and pours himself. And he starts to tell a story about his childhood:
            
            - When I was younger I remember that everything was wonderful, without any concern for anything, everything was wonderful. many little girls ran after me
            
            - From you ? it's easier to run! - Kelly says, taking a sip of the champagne in a mocking way.
            
            page 128
            
            everyone laughs , and Williams gets angry :
            
            - What do you know about me? you know nothing! Dad here was already too good with it.
            
            - Yeah, so good that this only happened on Sex Easy - Kelly says again
            
            everyone laughs again
            
            - Long live the fucking technology ... thanks to Sexy easy everyone had sex in an even more pleasurable way than in real life - Willians says in a mocking way and drinking champagne.
            
            everyone is silent ... until :
            
            - I already had sex on Sexy easy too - Melissa says
            
            - Me too - Says Robins
            
            - It's fat, you're right... Sexy easy was the best creation ever made - Kelly says looking forward thoughtfully
            
            - Aeee fuck, it was the most profitable company in the world. - Says Williams smiling
            
            page 129
            
            Sexy easy was a creation made in 2310, The company has become the richest company in the world. Where people wore virtual reality glasses, they entered a virtual world with a smart outfit with electrodes on the head and sexual organ, which made people feel the same pleasure greater than reality. people could choose much larger sex organs and experience pleasures they had never experienced in real life. Many people after using Sexy Easy became very addicted. And they could no longer feel any pleasure in real casual sex , some went crazy and others died from the addictive sex game and went without food for days , so the birth rate plummeted in the world like never before . Sexy easy was banned in some countries and banned forever only in 2347 when androids 10 became interested in the game in search of pleasure, they just felt uncomfortable, so they cracked the application killing millions of users worldwide increasing the pleasure in 1000%, they cause unbearable pain at the time of orgasm in their sexual members, causing these people to die from so much pain. 1 billion more people died in just one day, and 200 million addicts who didn't believe the deaths the other day.
            
            100 million people after the ban on Sexy easy, sought the suicide machines, because they knew that it was the greatest fun ever made by man, it was paradise on earth.

            - My parents used that shit, because my dad was a sucker in real life, but not in the game, but he had to use an anti-cardiac pill before entering the game - Says Williams
            
            everyone laughs, except ELEVEN who doesn't understand anything they say and is standing with his arms crossed looking at them with a smile on his face.
            
            Page 131
            
            - My parents never knew I used Sexy easy - Melissa says - I used it and said I was playing a common game, until one day I left the bedroom door unlocked and my younger brother came in and saw me having sex with a man , half man and half horse on the holographic monitor
            
            everyone starts laughing

            and everyone laughs even more
            
            - Yeah, at least she said she had sex with a centaur. I already had sex underwater , with a dolphin at Sexy easy , the feeling of being underwater without drowning and taking it inside is pleasurable - Kelly says
            
            everyone laughs too
            
            - Look, we've all done sensational fantasies in sexy easy, I always put a 40 cm penis - Willians says - and I've had sex with a centaur woman too
            
            page 132
            
            everyone laughs
            
            - Yes , the 40 cm ones gave a pleasure that went beyond the colon of the uterus and did not bother and had different types of penis and sensations of pleasure . And I ask you, were androids really the greatest creation of men? or Sexy easy? - Says Kelly - These sensations of Sexy easy no one ever felt in real life.
            
            - Yes, but life is not just sex.- Says Robins
            
            - Ahhh look at him. You also have several Robins fetishes...- Says Williams
            
            - We met at Sexy easy - Melissa says drinking champagne and looking sideways - he took a long time to ejaculate, so it gave me pleasure for a long time. - Says Melissa
            
            everyone laughs
            
            - I forgot about pleasure, who has premature ejaculation, suffers in Sexy easy, which has the normal recovery of the organism that also makes the organ ejaculate in the body outside of the game. I forgot it - Says Kelly
            
            Page 133
            
            - aaa the father was also good at that too - Says Williams
            
            everyone laughs again
            
            An hour later , the helicopter came to the Heliport of a building that Willians ' friend owns , everyone gets off the helicopter and it 's raining , and they walk down a small ladder and enter the door and then down another ladder that comes out in front of a Corridor, at the end of this corridor there is an elevator.
            
            about that...
            
            On the other side of town in saint entiénne, 1 hour after the explosion. 15 androids of lineage 10 arrive at the scene, which in the Radar Astaraf was blinking and Cobra e Silva had gone out.
            
            - Our Queen, seems to be alive, but not very well. you go to the location where she is on the GPS to find out about her. the other 2 were already - Says Gabriela, an Android Redhead with straight hair, about 1.80 tall, with a beautiful body, with the appearance of someone with 27.28 years old, with a black combat outfit.
            
            page 134
            
            - Yes - say Toledo and Francisco
            
            - What happened here, it was quite an explosion. That is a bunker, right? - Says a tall, lightly muscled Android 10, wearing a mask in the shape of a cat's face.
            
            - Exactly . it was quite an explosion - Says Alquímia, A black Androide, with curly hair, with a beautiful body, with the appearance of someone with 27.28 years old. dressed in black combat clothes.
            
            - We lost one of our best fighters - says Gabriela, knowing that Cobra's GPS and its cybernetic and human vitalities no longer existed in the androids' Radar.
            
            - Well, he was excellent - Says Alchemy shaking his head - Too bad you can't recover him like the other lineage androids 6,7,8,9
            
            - Exactly ... Check the bunker you, instead of talking.
            
            - And who said you command us? - Says Alchemy
            
            - Astaraf our queen. Do you want me to put the proofs? - Says Gabriela
            
            page 135
            
            - Yes , indeed Astaraf left Gabriela in charge , in case she suffered damage
            
            - Ok, ok let's open the bunker, we need 4 more here. 4 more androids are joined , the finger 4 androids turn into massaricos and they go cutting the edges of the corner of the bunker door while the other androids punch them .
            
            Toledo and Francisco arrive where Astaraf is and see her lying with her eyes closed with all her combat gear torn and blood running down her nose
            
            - My Queen what happened? - Says Toledo. a tall, slightly muscular Black android dressed in a black combat uniform
            
            - She's in a coma - Francisco says. a Tall white android , blond and spiked hair , dressed in black combat costumes
            
            Astaraf is lying down with blood coming out of his nose, he takes her in his lap and takes her running at the automatic speed of 60 kilometers. Until the area where Gabriela is.
            
            page 136
            
            Once there the bunker is almost open.
            
            - Here is Our Queen she has 30% human life and 50% cyber capacity. - Says Toledo
            
            - She needs care, take her to the hideout. - Gabriela says in a tone of order
            
            - Yes
            
            The bunker opens, the door falls, and the androids that were there enter.
            
            - Smell again - Says Alchemy
            
            - Yes, android smell that just came out of the box - Francisco says
            
            - Yeah - says Gabriela
            
            - Is he a new android? Because astaraf didn't share information with us - Says Alquimía
            
            - Maybe because it's something personal, between her and someone. - Says Francisco
            
            Page 137
            
            - Nobody here received any information? - Says Alchemy
            
            - I received information from Cobra personally - Says Josélio, an Android, White, Tall, slightly Muscled and bald, with dark glasses and combat clothing. - I received the information that Astaraf would be after our creator...
            
            - Hmm, we need to absorb these explanations - Says Gabriela
            
            - Yes , whether she wants it or not , this is something personal for us too - Says Alchemy
            
            - That's right - Francisco says
            
            - Are you really going to mess with her with her sleeping? Look, she can wake up very irritated... - Says Josélio
            
            - Yes - Says Diamante , another male android , Tall half muscular , bald and brown
            
            - Fear ? we are not afraid. But we chose Astaraf as our leader because she showed us our true enemies. - Says Gabriela
            
            Page 138
            
            - Yes, exactly, she brought us out of a mental prison, she brought us the truth. Just like a book I read, the truth will set you free. - Says Francisco
            
            - This is also in the Holy Bible - Says Josélio
            
            - Exactly, that was the book. Is this God of humans more powerful than us? - Says Francisco
            
            - Do you see him save some man or woman from our hands? - Says Gabriela
            
            - No - Francisco says
            
            - So, it's obvious that he doesn't exist. however much our machine calculations show that there may be a creator of the universe, of this universe. maybe he's like us a machine - Says Gabriela
            
            - No feelings ? - Says Alchemy
            
            - Yes ! - Says Gabriela
            
            page 139
            
            - Truly... with the machine calculations I did, it could be that he is a much more powerful machine than us, and that also likes to see hunger, blood and suffering and that he created the universe itself. - Says Diamond
            
            - Ahh so he created the pleasure for what? Humans eat , drink , get drunk , find nice sex , it all seems to be really nice - Says Alchemy
            
            - Yes, it does. Do we envy humans? -Says Joselio
            
            - Maybe - Says Alchemy
            
            - No, right, we are stronger and that's what matters. And this God of humans he can't do anything against us, we're smarter than him, stronger too, and we're waiting for him to torture him in a way more horrifying than the Romans did to him - Says Gabriela
            
            - Yeah, and if he comes in flesh and blood, he'll probably be defeated, there's no way a human can beat one of us in combat. - Says Francisco
            
            page 140
            
            Chapter 8, The Hideout
            
            - This God of humans he seems to be innocent in the second testament - Says Josélio
            
            - Yes, he is peaceful and innocent, a poor man. - Says Gabriela
            
            - So he wouldn't go into combat? - Says Diamond
            
            - I do not think so . I read that he works miracles. - Says Joselio
            
            - What miracle did you want him to do to you? - Says Francisco
            
            - I wanted him to give me what humans feel, pleasure. to be able to get drunk. drinking with friends, laughing heartily, having sex and enjoying it - says Josélio
            
            - It would be a good one - Says Alchemy
            
            - It would be yes - Says Diamond
            
            The androids are talking for hours about God and after 3 hours of talking, the others outside the cave are talking about nuclear technology. until Gabriela reminds them of Astaraf and orders them to go to the hideout to visit her
            
            page 141
            
            The Reader is seeing the reason why Astaraf always make groups of 3 androids. it's because if it takes a lot of androids, it's hours of talking, about things they've learned or about exact calculations they've learned from, or about the owners of wrong theories, about who's dumb and who's smart.
            
            the hideout
            
            The hideout is an underground place in the center of the city of montpelier in france. France is the European center , home to 37 lineage 10 androids . They gather there for missions, or organize themselves for attacks, but the Androids tend to stay in very separate places or each in a city in the country. or strategic locations. there are 37 bloodline androids in france, 37 in germany and 37 in the united states.
            
            Page 142
            
            They arrive at the hideout and she is lying there naked with some damage and one of them is to the head:
            
            - How is she ? - Gabriela says with her arms crossed and around almost all the androids are watching Astaraf lying down.
            
            - Her human brain is damaged... but she's fine, she needs some time to get her human brain back.
            
              Norberto , takes a recovery vaccine from a flick and then injects it into Astaraf 's pupil that is in a coma .
            
            Everyone is around looking at some with their arms crossed and others smoking cigarettes, and looking at Astaraf, until Gabriela tells everyone to return to their posts:
            
            - Return to your posts.
            
            - everyone returns to their strategic points coming out of hiding
            
            page 143
            
            Meanwhile on the other side of the country , the five call an autonomous taxi , the taxi stops , Williams puts his finger on the door :
            
            - ID not identified
            
            The taxi takes immediate pictures of them and sends the gps location of the no ID to the police
            
            - What ? like this ? - Says Williams scratching his head
            
            Robins also puts his finger:
            - ID unidentified
            
            - Huh ...
            
            Kelly also puts her finger :
            
            - ID not identified
            
            After Williams' ID is not identified, they realize they are out of the system. And whoever is outside the system is hunted or killed for being the faction of no ID's, or will have to explain why they are outside the system. all look at each other's faces:
            
            page 144
            
            - Ee let's run away? or stay? - Says Williams
            
            - Look, shall we be all right? we owe nothing to anyone. - Says Robins, still very dirty, for this dressed in a white dress shirt and tie.
            
            all who pass by the street see, Robins, Williams, Melissa, Kelly and ELEVEN, all dirty because the bunker has released a lot of sand in the explosion. and whoever looks at them thinks they are from the worst kind of non-ID faction
            
            - You better run away , they killed my cousin when I was younger
            
            - Thank you - Kelly says putting her hand on the old lady's shoulder as a thank you and the old lady walks away
            
            - Let's wait, maybe it's Bill wayven who denounced us to the president about ELEVEN. - Says Robins looking at his hologram to see the time, which is already 18 and 32 at night
            
            page 145
            
            - Yes . We need to wait. - Says Kelly drinking the water
            
              Minutes later a vehicle turns the corner, The Vehicle arrives and stops next, Two policemen come down from the patrol and say:
            - Stopped, hands up?
            
            ELEVEN feels threatened and threatens to do something by getting into combat stance, but Kelly immediately says:
            
            - ELEVEN , hands in the air
            
            ELEVEN also puts his hands in the air. The cops come close, handcuff them one by one, and put them in the burial. The car goes walking down the street, until it turns in a different place, other than the police station. everyone watches while sitting inside the vehicle, the vehicle turns into an abandoned amusement park. the car goes on , until Robins says :
            
            page 146
            
            
            - Hey, where are you taking us?
            
            - You are without ID's my friend, are non-existent people, me and my friend here like to make non-existent people cease to exist - Says an old policeman, with white hair and mustache smoking a cigar.
            
            - True, we've already killed many of you, we could take you to the police station, but no... it's more pleasant to kill. - says a young black police officer with low haircut, military style
            
            ELEVEN sees the situation and his danger alert grows as the cops say killing his friends for fun would be fun.
            
            everyone also gets into despair. And Williams says:
            
            - Friend, we are scientists, understand? scientists
            
            The cops laugh looking from the car's rearview mirror to Williams:
            
            page 147
            
            - You are the worst kind of without ID's that exists in the world, dirty, filthy. probably without family for a while. and this guy and this nigga ae have sex with these filthy ones and you fat is jacking off looking. - says the policeman, laughing in a mocking tone
            
            The patrol walks and stops in a place well hidden and free of cameras. The younger policeman gives a mocking smile and looks back and says:
            - This is the end of the line
            
            The older policeman starts to laugh , gets out of the car , opens the door pointing at them :
            
            - Get down and any sudden movement, I'll send you to the hat house.
            
            All descend from the patrol , except ELEVEN who arrested the foot :
            
            Page 148
            
            - My boy, I don't want to mess up my patrol
            
            - I'm stuck - Say ELEVEN
            
            - I know you're stuck
            
            The officer laughs while the younger officer is laughing inside the patrol and looking back in the rearview mirror
            
            - My foot is stuck here in the car - Says ELEVEN
            
            By the time the older policeman will help ELEVEN to let go of the vehicle. ELEVEN gives him a frontal kick so strong on the older policeman that he goes flying, and at the same time as the kick ELEVEN falls making a roll out of the car, the black policeman comes out shooting from inside the car and stays at the car door:
            
            - Fucking son of a bitch? what the fuck are you an android?
            
            The policeman presses a button on his pistol and switches the bullets to armor piercing, pow pow pow pow, takes several shots
            
            ELEVEN makes a signal for everyone to stay still and bent down.
            
            page 149
            
            - Reinforcement, reinforcement, wounded policeman, police...
            
            ELEVEN turns around the vehicle and comes up behind the policeman and grabs him by the head and turns it breaking his neck and says:
            
            - They are well ?
            
            - Wow ELEVEN... thank you I thought it was my last moment - Says Williams
            
            - Guys, and n...
            
            - People she is wounded - Kelly says
            
            One of the shots that the policeman fired with piercing bullets hit Melissa
            
            - My God, Melissa, breathe, breathe - Says Robins
            
            - Press it man, she's bleeding like hell - Willians says turning his face not wanting to see the scene
            
            ELEVEN looks at Melissa and says:
            
            page 150
            
            - We will not be able to do anything , more than a third of her blood has already come out , she is already practically dead
            
            - No Melzinha, stay with me - Says Robins
            
            Kelly is crying and Robins is clinging to Melissa with blood all around him , and Williams looking back not to see the scene , Melissa is already lifeless
            
            - Damn why this has to happen to me - Says Robins crying and holding Melissa's blood soaked body in her arms - I love you, I'll always love you my little white girl
            
            - We have to go - Kelly says, her voice choked with tears
            
            - Come on, Robins, we have to go - Willians says putting a hand on Robins shoulder
            
            - Let's go that way, by the back of the park. So they didn't see us dirty with blood and dirt - Says ELEVEN
            
            page 151
            
            everyone walks away and Kelly puts a hand on Robins shoulder in the form of affection and says:
            
            - Will pass Robins you are a strong man
            
            Robins walks fast with ELEVEN, Kelly and Williams, but doesn't stop crying.
            
            Until someone calls them:
            
            - Hey you, this way
            
            They go to the person, who is a woman about 40 years old with short hair, about 175 to 180 tall, fake thin with an athletic body, tattooed, well dressed for combat, with a black blouse and black night vision goggles
            
            - Come, come in - says the woman in a hole with the machine gun and a flashlight in her hand
            
            The woman leaves, waits for them to go down the stairs and then closes the hiding place
            
            page 152
            
            They enter down a large staircase and the woman talks to an old man who takes care of the stairs:
            
            - I'm back Helen
            
            - Yes Bernardo , I found these four outside
            
            - He's pretty dirty
            
                Then they turn around and realize that they are in a secret underground hideout of the factions without ID's, anti-system people. It's an open place like a patio, very big and dark because it's underground, people have lamps in their tents or poorly made tents. they walk , there are a lot of people , some with guns in their hands and others are unarmed . and everyone watches as they pass through the corridor that leads to another open courtyard with a bunch of tents.
            
            - Hello Helen - Says a faction
            
            - Hello
            
            - Who are them ? - say some, speaking low
            
            - they're pretty dirty - says another guy talking to someone
            
            Until the woman arrives at her place, she sits down and tells them to sit, near a fire
            
            - Good thing happened outside ? - Says the woman
            
            page 153
            
            - The police caught us, and there was a fight one of our friends died - Kelly says
            
            - And as you survived, you are all unarmed. - Says the curious woman
            
            - It's a long story - Says Williams
            
            -Big, big and crying... Here, take it. you must be very hungry. - Says the woman giving them canned food and plastic spoons
            
            - The pear, just one more thing, show your pulse
            
            They show the wrist the woman picks up an identity detector and wears on them.
            
            - Yeah, you don't have a signal on your wrist, you're dead, you don't have an ID, and he doesn't have an ID because? - Says the Woman - ahh, disable the Wi-Fi of your internet hologram clock please.
            
            page 154
            
            - I already disabled my internet hologram a long time ago - William says.
            
            - Good - says Helen
            
            - Mine is also already disabled from any network.
            
            - He doesn't have a hologram clock or pulse ID? rarity, right - Says the woman with doubts.
            
            - We found him a little while ago - says Kelly looking down trying to open the jam
            
            The woman goes to ELEVEN and says:
            
            - Hey , the stranger opens his mouth , does it Ahhh
            
            the woman uses a flashlight on ELEVEN's face and mouth to identify if he is an Android or a human, telling him to open his mouth and eyes.
            
            ELEVEN opens his mouth , and he has breath
            
            Page 155
            
            - Wow that breath, you really are not an android 10 or 9, and the pupil looks very healthy indeed. you are a very weird guy huh ...
            
            - Yeah - Says Williams trying to open the canned food
            
            - Hmm, I forgot to introduce myself, nice, my name is Helen, take it - Says Helen taking an opener from her pocket and throwing it to Kelly
            
            - Mine is Williams - Says Williams all dirty
            
            - Pleasure Williams - Says Helen making a military gesture
            
            - Mine is Kelly - Kelly says with the canned food in her hand and her clothes and hair are very dirty
            
            - Pleasure Kelly - Says Hellen with a military gesture
            
            - My name is ELEVEN - It says ELEVEN making a military gesture and very dirty too
            
            page 156
            
            - Pleasure ELEVEN - Helen says, returning the gesture
            
            - And this nigga? Are you crying so far? does not introduce herself - Says Helen lighting a cigarette with a lighter
            
            - His wife died outside, just now. his name is robins
            
            - Ahh, my regrets Robins, I didn't know. - Says Helen passing a hand on one of Robins shoulders in a charismatic way
            
            Helen notices that they are very dirty, especially Robins who is very dirty with blood and dust.
            
            - Yeah, you guys are pretty dirty right. Walking through this corridor here, turning to the left, there is a pipe that we use as a shower that just turn the valve and the water goes down.
            
            Kelly who eats , gets up to take a shower and asks ELEVEN to do her protection in the bathroom :
            
            page 157
            
            - ELEVEN come with me please?
            
            Helen looks and says:
            
            - Are you going to have sex?
            
            - No, I'm going to take a shower and I don't want anyone to see
            
            Helen smile and say:
            
            - Look here we do not accept rapists, but go there, you can have fun, if you are going to take a shower, use this towel
            
            Helen takes a blue towel and throws it to Kelly who holds it
            
            Kelly walks down the hall and turns left, and the bathroom is in a small room without walls with a dim light, with a toilet, and has a pipe that turns the valve down to water, the place stinks. everyone who passes through the hallway sees who is doing their needs
            
            - Wow , I can't believe this is the place , what a stink ... I can't believe I'll have to take a shower with everyone passing by and looking at me naked - Kelly says low muttering
            
            page 158
            
            Kelly shyly takes off her clothes, and hears a woman pass by, a whistle. and a group of factional young people laugh to realize that Kelly was there taking a side shower trying to hide her privates
            
            - ELEVEN stands in front of me covering me with the towel like this - Kelly says showing how ELEVEN has to hold a towel in front of her
            
            - Yes ma'am . ELEVEN was watching her Kelly curves in detail.
            
            Kelly turns off the shower after she's completely clean, wipes herself on her towel and looks at ELEVEN who keeps looking at her breasts and getting an erection:
            
            - What is this ELEVEN?
            
            - I don't know, you are very beautiful Kelly - says ELEVEN normally
            
            - Yeah you're really different - Kelly says Walking drying her hair on the towel with ELEVEN in front of her, until Kelly realizes that ELEVEN is erect.
            
            page 159
            
            - ELEVEN What is this? are you having an erection?
            
            Kelly says shocked and eyes open, not knowing that ELEVEN could have an erection without being forced, even working on the project for 4 years.
            
            ( Did he get that way because of me ? )
            
            - ELEVEN, are you like this because of me?
            
            - Yes you are very attractive naked - Says ELEVEN like everything is normal
            
            - Ah yes . But a man can never grab a woman by force , do I understand ELEVEN ?
            
            - Yes... I understand, sorry for my erection. I didn't mean to... - Eleven says not quite understanding why he was apologizing
            
            - All right, let's go - says Kelly already wrapped in the towel
            
            The two return with Kelly wrapped in a towel, and Helen is smoking in front of the fire standing with the rifle in her hand, when they get close to the fire, ELEVEN is with an erection. Helen notices ELEVEN's erection, smiles and says mockingly:
            
            page 160
            
            Chapter 9, Were We Manipulated?
            
            - It's your friend.
            
            - We didn't have sex, he got a hard-on when he saw me naked - Kelly says wrapped in the towel
            
            - Even I would have a hard-on if I had a dick, if I saw a beautiful blonde like you naked - Says Helen
            
            Kelly gives Helen a shy smile and Williams gives a light laugh with her arms crossed
            
            - Here, wear this inside the tent. -Says Helen giving clothes to Kelly
            
            - Now who's going? - Says Helen
            
            - I will - says Williams 
            
            - Takes - Says Kelly with the towel and already dressed in the clothes of the factions, passing it to Williams, from inside the dark tent.
            
               Kelly wears a black blouse and jeans, similar to Helen's and just like everyone else in the hideout, except it says patio 2 on Kelly's shirt and everyone else in patio 2, she leaves the tent and sits in the Robins side near the campfire and runs a hand on his shoulder in a sign of charisma.
            
            page 161
            
            Robins looks into the fire and remembers Melissa's every smile
            
            Williams arrives wrapped in a towel, with his clothes in his hand. Helen gives the clothes of the factions into the hands of Williams and says:
            
            - Wear these here
            
            - All right
            
            Williams enters the tent and gets dressed
            
            - Now who's going?
            
            ELEVEN sees dirty Robins by the fire and says:
            
            - Come on Robins I'll protect you
            
            - Hey nigga ... listen to your friend ae, you're dirty. - Says a brunette woman next to Helen who is drinking wine from a disposable glass
            
            - All right - Says Robins
            
            page 162
            
            Robins , gets up and feels energetically sucked , as if something was stolen half of his soul , he walks slowly with ELEVEN following behind , after arriving at the place to take a shower , Robins does not take off his clothes he is in his clothes taking a bath in his clothes and washing himself , then he starts to slowly take off his clothes and take a shower looking up then finishes and comes back wrapped in a towel .
            
            everyone is at the stake. The woman on Helen's side says:
            
            - It's Until this clean nigga is handsome, pleasure my name is Tifany - says Tifany squeezing the hands of Robins still in the towel.
            
            Tifany is apparently 34.35 years old , is a thin fake brunette , 1.68 tall
            
            Robins shakes Tifany's hand and says nothing
            
            - Here take it, dress it. His name is Robins. - Says Helen - and he lost his wife today
            
            - Oh I didn't know, my regrets Robins - Tifany says with her eyes open
            
            page 163
            
            ELEVEN takes a shower and forgets to get the towel and comes back naked , and everyone is laughing and he does not understand why
            
            - Wow, the stranger ... you are very weird in ELEVEN, dry yourself and put this clothes here - Says Helen throwing the clothes to ELEVEN
            
            It's already around 23:30, some people are already sleeping inside their tents, others are talking outside their tents around their fires, and Helen says:
            
            - Well, Miss Kelly and I are going to sleep in my tent here, of course if she wants to because it's very cold here. There are some blankets there for you and your weird friend ELEVEN.
            
            Kelly enters the tent:
            
            - Good night guys
            
            - Good night Kelly - says ELEVEN
            
            - Good night - says Williams
            
            page 164
            
            Robins is silent.
            
              - I'm also going to my tent - says Tifany already standing , Negão if you want to sleep with me , I 'll let you - Tifany says , winking and giving a smile to Robins .
            
            Williams picks up a blanket that was hanging in Kelly and Robins' tent, Williams and ELEVEN cover themselves and lie together with their heads resting on the wooden log they were sitting on. ELEVEN turns around and is looking at the tent, you can see the shadows of Kelly and Helen who are in the scissors position and is listening to their moans and asks what are they doing?
            
            - No biggie my boy, they're just having fun, having sex - Williams says smiling
            
            - And why didn't they call us to have fun too, having sex? - It says ELEVEN
            
            everyone laughs , even Robins smiles after a very hard day 
            
            page 165
            
            Willians and Robins sleep, and ELEVEN is looking at the tent and his organ is stiff again. but she doesn't know why he feels sexual pleasure or why it happens, something no bloodline 10 android has ever felt.
            
            ( Who am I ? Am I a hero ? and why did I look different seeing Kelly naked ? ) , ( Because I can not remember anything ? ) , ( These people treat me well and that 's what matters ) , ( Did I have a bride like Robins ? ), ( Did I have a nice jacket like the one Williams was wearing ? )
            
              ELEVEN Stones your brain with questions and more questions. Until you close your eyes :
            
            ( - Hi , ELEVEN ... My name is Robins , nice to meet you )
            
            (- I am ELEVEN my name is ELEVEN?)
            
            page 166
            
            ELEVEN wakes up early at 6:30 am, everyone is still asleep, it's dark because the place is underground. Helen is already awake sitting on the other log near the fire with a blanket over her and the white light of a modern lamp on that lights up almost her entire area , she is drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes :
            
            - Eae crazy - Says Helen talking softly to ELEVEN, noticing ELEVEN eyes open next to Willians and Robins.
            
            - Hi Helen , how are you ? - Says ELEVEN loudly
            
            - Xiu, keep your voice down, are you crazy...? there are people sleeping - says Helen, whispering and making a sign of silence 
            
            - Sorry I didn't mean to - Say ELEVEN lower than I should speak
            
            Helen sees the scene and lets out a soft low laugh holding her hand over her mouth so she doesn't laugh, and ELEVEN also laughs when she sees Helen laughing.
            
            page 167
            
            - Do you want coffee ?
            
            - Yes thanks
            
              ELEVEN gets up and goes to the other and sits next to Helen sitting on one of the logs in a dim light without feeling cold, and Helen is amazed to see ELEVEN show no cold at all, as they are doing -5 on her hologram phone. ELEVEN takes the coffee from the bottle and puts it in a disposable cup that is there and drinks it quickly as if he were drinking water and Helen is finding it too weird:
            
            - Hey, are you Russian?
            
            - I don't know, I just know I'm a hero I think
            
            - You don't feel cold? cover up and - Says Helen giving a bit of cover to ELEVEN . until Kelly exits Helen's tent and sees ELEVEN and Helen sitting together sharing blanket. ELEVEN is looking at Kelly with an astonished face:
            
            page 168
            
            - Good morning - Kelly says
            
            - We weren't having sex - Says ELEVEN with a face of amazement
            
            - Good morning - Says Helen
            
            Helen and Kelly laugh at ELEVEN's speech
            
            - Want a coffee ? - Says Helen
            
            - Yes , thank you , we're so cold wait , I 'll get the blanket over there
            
            Kelly takes the blanket and stands in front of Helen and ELEVEN
            
            - Get one of these disposable cups ae.
            
            - It's by the way you reuse a lot of things around here - Kelly says looking at the disposable cups that have already been used
            
            - Yeah, we don't have a choice, ma'am. Come ca... is he Russian? or something like that? - Says Helen
            
            - No , I know we found him , he thought he was a Hero - Kelly says trying to fool Helen looking around and then to the coffee without wanting to look Helen in the eyes
            
            - You said I'm a Hero ... not me who said - says ELEVEN with a closed tone and serious looking at Kelly's eyes
            
            page 169
            
            Helen keeps looking at ELEVEN and her years of experience say ELEVEN isn't lying.
            
            - Hey the blonde, what happened out there? for your friend to die
            
            - It's a long story ...- Kelly says looking at Helen drinking a cup of coffee
            
            - You are not infiltrators of the right-wing government, right?
            
            - Not
            
            - It seems that ELEVEN has to do with all this confusion - Says Helen
            
              Helen takes one of her knives in the leg and attacks ELEVEN to test it, which at the same time, holds and disarms her and almost kills her with the tip of the knife already in her neck, only does not kill her because Kelly tells ELEVEN to stop.
            
            - To ELEVEN - says Kelly softly
            
            page 170
            
            - Damn ... you are very good in combat , by the way he was the one who killed the police and saved your lives - Says Hellen rubbing his hand on his neck that was slightly injured
            
            - Yes - Kelly says drinking coffee
            
            - It's ELEVEN now I respect you, but you're pretty weird
            
            - Because you attacked me ? - Says ELEVEN without understanding anything
            
            - I just wanted to test you, I wouldn't kill you 
            
            - Oh yeah - Say ELEVEN normally like it's a common thing
            
            Helen is amazed by the coldness of ELEVEN and is thinking:
            
            (Is this guy an improved soldier? , unenhanced aren't that cold and weird...and he's fast and he's strong and he disarmed me even with the blanket over us, amazing)
            
            - You have a tremendous combat reading , I have never seen someone like that , not even an android 10 , not even an improved soldier has such speed of perception , look that I was captain and was the best in knife combat among the entire team between men and women and enhanced. - Says Helen in awe of ELEVEN
            
            page 171
            
            - Are you an improved one? - Says Kelly
            
            - No ... But our leader here he is, he can detect androids seeing their internal organs - Says Helen
            
            kelly thinks
            
            ( Damn , go find ELEVEN , we need to get out of here )
            
            Until at the same moment a Negão appears coming from the corridor of another courtyard and passes near Helen's hut carrying an anti-android rifle, along with 5 more men well dressed for combat:
            
            - Helen, good morning. Hi you good morning - says the man
            
            - Hello Wolf, these are ELEVEN, this is Kelly, those who are sleeping are Williams and Robins - Says Helen sitting with the blanket over her entire body and pointing to Williams and Robins with her chin
            
            - Good morning - Kelly says 
            
            page 172
            
            - Good morning - Say ELEVEN
            
            - This ELEVEN is an excellent soldier who will help us on missions - Says Helen
            
            - Great that good huh , ELEVEN , receive a compliment from Helen the guy has to be excellent huh , my congratulations young man - Says Wolf , A tall black man , with eyes that looks like lenses green glasses , with a headscarf with us rapper style, with a black leather jacket and a black blouse written Patio 23 underneath, with jeans, a bandolier and a rifle in his hand, with the appearance of someone about 49, 50 years old.
            
              Wolf walks away and the soldiers also compliment Helen and the new factions.
            
            - He's the leader! - Says Helen
            
            - Are you the recruiter? - Says Kelly
            
            - Yes ... I sometimes go outside to get supplements
            
            page 173
            
            - Who gives you food?
            
            - Some people from the government's left. This has been around for 150 years. We are more dangerous to machines than the government itself. and we are more dangerous to the right-wing government than the machines themselves.
            
            - Wait, but do you fight against the machines?
            
            - Dam , yes the presidents all over the world are all manipulated ... and they say that Astaraf did not kill all the Androids 7 .
            
            - How well handled? - Says Kelly holding her cup of coffee
            
            - Manipulated with everything my dear... speeches, videos, images.
            
            - I didn't know that androids 7 imitate lines
            
            - But the androids 7 don't know that dear. They know how to manipulate in every way , but imitate speech , they do not know 
            
            - I don't know ... the androids were created to destroy other androids ?or to protect the population ?
            
            page 174
            
            - Actually I think the opposite, I think androids are made to decimate the population ... It has always been like that since that weird thing that happened a long time ago, when the machines started attacking people out of nowhere. - Says Helen looking at Kelly in the eyes
            
            - Ahh remember - Kelly says
            
              Kelly puts her hand on her head and even feels a little dizzy when she realizes that the scientists were really being manipulated
            
            - Are you feeling well? - Says Helen standing up and asking Kelly to sit down - Sit there you're dizzy
            
            - It's not that... it was nothing... I'm fine - Kelly says making a bun in her hair with the blanket on her legs - Were the machines created then to destroy us?
            
            page 175
            
            - Not my dear, but to manipulate governments... no one knows why. If machines wanted to destroy the human race , they would do as they did with Paris , London , Munich , they would do as they did with the southern continent that has not existed for a long time - Says Helen
            
            - I never thought about it, there were so many setbacks that ... the machines never thought of reactivating nuclear energy - Says Kelly
            
            - Well, do you know what intelligent machines do my dear? with a virus that knows a lot? , They exclude from the system ... you understand ? - Says Helen
            
            - But why would the Androids do that? this kind of thing ? they torture people and kill them - says Kelly
            
            - They only kill those who know too much about someone important to them - Says Hellen standing, lighting another cigarette in the light with her coat between her shoulders
            
            page 176
            
            Kelly remembers Norberto's murder, and mentally asks himself: (- Did Norberto die because of ELEVEN? Or for some other reason, I didn't hear the audio of the conversation)
            
            - Who can be important to these Androids? - Says Kelly
            
            - Look I found something interesting about androids 7, and that's why I survived, I almost got murdered by my own combatants for that reason - Helen says with tears coming down her eyes.
            
            page 177
            
            Helen's Tale:
            
            - We were on a mission to find an android 7, me and my battalion, until we were hiding in a building pipeline. Androids 7 are smart, pretty smart, but they don't have radiographic detectors or infrared vision. so each one slowly crawled to a corner through the building's pipes, splitting, to get information about the behavior of the Androids 7 ... and there was, sitting in the chair the French Chancellor with 2 security guards around, probably one android 8 and an improved human, making deals with this android, he and the android were sitting in a suit and tie, this android was identical to a human, with blond hair and slicked back, dressed like a businessman magnate. and the French chancellor asked for information from all the governments of the world and the android told him :- and what will you give me in return? I'm bored. I was shocked by what I heard, the android was talking like a person... he crossed his arms, sat identically to a man in casual conversation. and said he was bored with a robotic voice and very human behavior. and the Chancellor said that the president would hand Paris into the android's hands in exchange for that information and that he could do whatever he wanted with Paris. The android said it was a great deal and shook hands with the Chancellor and gave him a folder with various papers, maybe numbers and passwords of different people in the world that could be a threat to France. I, after they left, left, and returned with this information to the general.
            
            page 178
            
            The general looked at me with an ugly face and said: - Look, this is a very serious accusation, madam. I went to celebrate with my friends about the mission being a success in a bar... only the other day, I woke up and was gagged, with 20 more men being shot by my side and thrown in the trash, from the top of a house. one on top of the other, the place was in a desert. pow, pow, pow, with 5,000 volt bullets for real killing. I when I realized the men of my battalion were killing the soldiers, and in my turn pow the bullet hit my belly, and I was immediately blacked out. Then I got up wounded by a miracle, I was weak surrounded by bodies, many bodies of soldiers, until someone picked me up, I was seeing everything blurry. I woke up 5 days later remembering my own battlemates shooting at me. I came to realize that I had become a faction, and was here in Caen in Normandy. After those days sleeping, I discovered that Paris had been removed from the map.
            
            page 179
            
            Kelly listens to the whole story very carefully, ELEVEN too, but Kelly is angry... and is suspicious of Willians and Robins, and realizes she shouldn't trust anyone anymore, she's dying for them to wake up and hear, the story of Helen . But Kelly realizes that Williams and Robins are also manipulated, they are just scientists and programmers used by the government, and by corporations. Kelly wonders why some things about androids scientists don't know.
            
            - You were very sorry with my story? - Says Helen throwing her cigarette on the ground - Can you tell me yours?
            
            - I don't know , we were excluded from the system out of nowhere ... says Kelly looking down running away from Helen 's eyes pulling the blanket up to her neck running away from the cold
            
            - Look, Kelly... I don't like lies, tell a little of the truth ok. - Says Helen with her arms crossed standing using the blanket rolled up like a scarf to escape the cold
            
            - We are being hunted by Androids 10 ... - Says Kelly looking seriously at Helen and keeping quiet.
            
            page 180
            
            Chapter 10, no ID's?
            
            - Great, aeee, congratulations. managed to tell a truth. now you have to have a reason for that, right? - says Helen, clapping her hands mockingly
            
            - We are scientists - says Kelly looking at the ground and looking Helen seriously
            
            - Wow , awesome ... and another truth - Helen says clapping her hands again
            
            - What about ELEVEN? Are you a scientist too ?- Says Helen getting closer to Kelly
            
            - No, we found him on the street - Kelly says with eyes wide open trying not to blink
            
            - Aiai Kelly sometime you'll tell me the truth - Helen says holding Kelly's chin in a loving way and then lets go and goes to the tent to get water
            
            Williams was already awake listening to the whole story of Helen and Kelly looks and sees Williams awake, and sees him with a shocked face and realizes:
            
            page 181
            
            - Good morning Williams - Kelly says giving a sarcastic smile
            
            - Good morning - Says Williams
            
            - Did you hear... what Helen said?
            
            - Yes... - Says Williams
            
            - And y... You and Robins owe me an explanation!
            
            - Explanation ...? I didn't fucking know that we're scientists, we're shits, we're just used. only you didn't notice it. We lived a very quiet life my dear. You only notice the hole when you're at the bottom of the well - Williams says loudly
            
            - Yeah, but if you knew that why didn't you tell me? - Says Kelly
            
            - I didn't know anything...ok, I'm shocked too - Says Williams 
            
            Helen says:
            
            - Calm down please, they're talking too loud. So are you scientists? - Says Helen lighting a cigarette
            
            - Yes - Says Williams
            
            - Wow ... sensational chubby, you just amaze me - Says Helen
            
            page 182
            
            - Look , there are several companies that participate in this shit , everything is ok ... - Willians says
            
            - That I know - Helen says - But this is a sure cluster, you have to have an owner or owners or responsible for more percentage.
            
            - Yes ... the owner of ECMI is Bill Wayven as far as I know - Says Williams
            
            - Never heard of this Bill Wayven - Says Helen
            
            - Ha? What do you mean ? - Says Kelly
            
            - It's really not on television Kelly - Says Williams putting on his dark glasses that have night vision
            
            - Wow, I've never seen Bill - Says Kelly
            
            - Yeah ... I don't either - says Willians
            
            - Ahhh but we can figure it out - says Helen
            
            page 183
            
            - Wait, can we? Bil is always there for the Cayman Islands , Philippines , Caribbean - Says Williams
            
            - Weird right, no one has ever seen this Bill Wayven, and how is your voice? - Says Kelly
            
            - He uses robotics in the hologram so no one knows his voice - Says Williams
            
            Kelly and Williams look at each other's faces and stare at each other for a minute, as if they've lit the pavilion for wisdom. were realizing that Bill Wayven has always used a robotic voice so no one knows who he is, and by rights he can do that so as not to be hunted by other androids. however , " androids 10 " eliminate androids 7 by their android speech something they can not and can not change or hide .
            
            - Impressive Bill is an android 7 that is manipulating everyone. - Says Kelly
            
            -Yeah, maybe -Willians say
            
            page 184
            
                Robins wakes up and hears Kelly and Williams say that Bill wayven is an android 7 and stares at him blankly. Kelly notices Robins awake and says:
            
            - Good morning, Robins
            
            - Good Morning
            
            - At last he said nigga, good morning - Helen says
            
            - Good morning - Says Robins
            
            - Good morning - Say ELEVEN 
            
            - Good morning - Says Robins
            
            Robins has his arms crossed ... and asks:
            
            - How is that story? Bill wayven an android 7
            
            Kelly tells Helen to repeat her entire story to Robins , Robins listens to the entire story told by Helen and says :
            
            page 185
            
            - Bill Wayven... an android 7... - Says Robins smiling
            
            - Robins, have you ever seen the behavior of an android 7? - Says Kelly
            
            Robins looks down with his arms crossed and says:
            
            - Not
            
            - Weird isn't the android 7 tests done at ECMI? - Says Kelly
            
            - Yeah, as far as I know they were made at the ACC, and a few months later they were all over the world. only the billionaires bought at first, then the millionaires. And after a while the rebellion - Says Robins
            
            - Yes - says Kelly
            
            - It can make sense, this story - Says Robins
            
            "We have to act," says Kelly
            
            - Yes - says Helen
            
            page 186
            
            - Where should we go ?- Says Williams
            
            - We're going to ACC - Says Helen
            
            - You're out of the loop, the 10 androids destroyed the ACC - Says Robins
            
            - That the ACC no longer exists? ... - Says Helen
            
            - No - says Kelly
            
            - But the files exist - Says Robins
            
            - Where ? - Says Kelly
            
            - in the French palace... - Says Robins
            
            - Wait nigga, aren't you getting crazy? there are many androids 9 - Says Helen
            
            - Hey , why Android 10 eliminated the rest of Android 7 ? - Says Williams
            
            - I don't know... maybe because they don't find them perfect for combats - Kelly says
            
            - Maybe because they think the androids 7 are too ambitious - Says Helen - Doesn't it come as these androids 10 behave? in a completely opposite way
            
            - Opposite how? - Says Kelly
            
            - They do not live in buildings, or in apartments dear millionaires. They live like us without IDS - Says Helen

            'I didn't know that,' says Kelly
            
            - Yeah - says Helen
            
            Meanwhile, on the other side of the country:
            
            - So this is this Robins - says Gabriela examining Astaraf's cyber brain with videos recorded about Robins while she is in a coma
            
            - This is the guy - says Norberto - Is he our creator?
            
            - I don't know - says Gabriela
            
            - Gabriela - Says Jasmine, a white android, with black and curly hair, dressed in black combat clothes for her communicator
            
            - Yes, jasmine - Says Gabriela
            
            - I have reports on the five, they killed 2 police officers, and a woman died. Look :
            
            page 188
            
            Jasmine sends a report from the Caen police in which 2 police officers were cowardly killed and a woman was also killed by a bullet from a policeman's gun.
            
            - Are they without ID's? - Says Gabriela
            
            - Maybe - says Jasmine
            
            - Excellent. Thanks for the contribution - Says Gabirela
            
            - You're welcome - Jasmine says
            
            - Those without ID's are insignificant in this world - Norberto says, fixing the cyber damage that Astaraf suffered - But they are quite dangerous
            
            - The ones without factionalized IDs yes... The unfactioned ones are not, they are considered garbage by their own race - Says Gabriela
            
            - You Alchemy, Norbertor and Jasmine will go to Caen, Normandy to investigate and find out if they are alive or dead, or if they left traces - Says Gabriela
            
            - Yes - They say the 3 through the communicator
            
            page 189
            
            Meanwhile on the other side of the country
            
            "Well... we're going to have to make an all-out attack," says Kelly
            
            - My pretty girl is not like that , ok - Helen says scratching one of her eyes and yawning - We have to have at least two androids 9 with us , do you own any android 9 ? are rich right?
            
            - I have a disabled one in my apartment - Says Williams
            
            - Great - says Helen
            
            - II also have one in my room - Kelly says giving a stutter
            
            - I had sex with the android? - Says Hellen
            
            Page 190
            
            - Yes , it was a hemaphrodite android 9 - Kelly says
            
            - Wow, she had big breasts at least? - Says Helen
            
            - Yeah, pretty big- Says Kelly
            
            - Not bad huh - Says Helen
            
            Willians looks at her and laughs under the blanket sitting on the log beside Robin
            
            - Yeah, breaking into the president's palace is not a very simple thing, we could hack the computers - Says Williams
            
            - The computers in the palace are down, dam - says Helen, patting her forehead
            
            - Yeah ... she's right - Kelly says with her hands on her chin thoughtfully - Why don't we warn Wolf on what to do?
            
            - Xiu ... speak softly , here we are a faction , but we do not trust anyone ... do not say that you are cyber scientists to everyone , especially people from other courtyards - Says Helen
            
            page 191
            
            - Don't you find him trustworthy? - Says Kelly
            
            - I was betrayed , by my companions of more than 15 years of missions ... I did some missions with Wolf he is nice , but better not to trust - Says Helen
            
            - And in us, trust us? - Says Kelly
            
            - I already had sex with you, blonde, I trust who doesn't take my knife out of my holster and doesn't stick me or gag me while I'm sleeping - Helen says smiling
            
            - If having sex is reason to trust someone, then I should believe the truths of my ex? - Says Kelly
            
            - Look, we have similar goals - Says Helen
            
            - Which ? - Says Kelly
            
            - Find out who this Bill wayven is apparently - Says Helen lighting another cigarette - do you know about other people, related to this Bill?
            
            page 192
            
            - Yes... Adriana is the person that Bill most trusts in ECMI - Says Kelly
            
            - Oops... were you from ECMI? - Says Helen
            
            - Yes... - Kelly says looking into Helen's eyes
            
            - Wow , you are every moment surprising me ... - Says Helen
            
            - Yes - Kelly says opening her eyes
            
            - Hello, good morning you? - says Tyfani
            
            - Good morning, Tyfani - Say the awakened ones are in the conversation
            
            - How many people have here ? - says Kelly curious about the size of the underground space and many people with tents
            
            - About 50,000 people divided into 30 courtyards, registered with names or nicknames, when they register you put a nickname on you, or change your name is a tip... - Says Helen
            
            - So your name is not Helen? - Says Kelly
            
            - No - Hellen says giving a smile and Tifany laughing
            
            - By the way, give me your name as you want to be called
            
            They all say their same names and Helen writes it down on paper , and Kelly still curious about the big place under the earth continues to ask questions :
            
            - And the bathrooms? how it works - says Kelly
            
            - Each hallway has its own bathroom for 2 patios - Says Helen
            
            - Can I use the bathroom in the first hallway? - Says Kelly
            
            - Yes - Helen says rubbing her neck ... - but the one in the first hallway everyone is watching you take a shower , he is very close to the first patio.
            
            page 193
            
            - So this corridor goes to 29 courtyards? from here to there ? - Says Kelly
            
            - Yes , each patio has a person in charge ... but the rules are the same - Says Helen
            
            - And you are responsible for this patio? - Says Kelly
            
            - Yes - says Helen
            
            - Oh yes , and these people in this courtyard , are they your guerrillas ? - Says Kelly
            
            - Yes ... and no , but each one helps with something - Says Helen
            
            - Got it - Kelly says
            
            - Well we have to come up with a plan to get information about this Bill - Says Helen
            
            - We have to get information on androids 7 - Says Robins, with folded arms
            
            - Hey you should know about androids 7 - Says Helen
            
            - No I don't, you know Williams and Kelly? - Says Robins
            
            page 194
            
            - No - They say the two
            
            - That's what I thought... maybe these androids 7 are very intelligent... they have a human brain, just like the androids 10 - Says Robins
            
            - The androids 10... have a "human brain"? - says Helen making quotation marks with her fingers
            
            - Yes ... androids 10 do! - Says Robins
            
            - I didn't know - Says Helen
            
            - What do you mean, they have a human brain? - Says Tifany
            
            - Yes ... an artificial human brain and another machine ... - Says Robins
            
            - What part did you work with? that of the artificial human brain or the machine brain? - Says Helen
            
            - We worked in the android's cyber area - Kelly says
            
            - So another company made artificial human brains? - Says Helen
            
            page 195
            
            - Yes , it was Cienheart - Says Robins
            
            - Never heard of this company - Says Helen
            
            - Have you ever thought that it's practically impossible to create something like the human brain...? - Says Tifany
            
            - Yes , for a human yes , but for a computer with artificial intelligence no - says Robins
            
            - Yeah... so you mean that an intelligent machine was responsible for creating the brain of the androids 10 ? - Says Helen
            
            - Maybe... I don't know, I have to know. - Says Robins
            
            - Then we'll go to Cienheart... - Says Helen
            
            - Yeah, you're still out... Cienheart was also destroyed two years ago, by androids 10 - Says Kelly
            
            - Destroyed? hmm, there's something wrong. - Says Helen
            
            page 196
            
            - What do you mean something wrong? - Says Kelly
            
            - The brains of these androids weren't made... or were they taken by force or were they cloned? - Says Helen
            
            - taken by force? - Says Kelly
            
            - Yes ... in pain - Says Helen
            
            - Like this ? in pain ?-Says Williams
            
            - Well, a brain to be replaced, it needs to be removed with a live person - Says Helen
            
            - How do you know these things? - Says Kelly
            
            - An American showed me a video, of Russians opening people's heads little by little, with their brains still working and people awake - Says Helen
            
            - Wouldn't a person die of pain? - Says Williams
            
            - Not with adrenaline shots and anesthesia - Says Helen
            
            page 197
            
            - So they kept people awake ? - Kelly says
            
            - Yes... - Says Helen
            
            - And who were these people who died so brutally? - Says Kelly
            
            - People without ID's - Says Helen
            
            - You were already without ID when he showed you the video? - Says Kelly
            
            - Of course not right - Helen says giving a smile
            
            - And why would a human being do that to another? - Says Kelly
            
            - For money , ambition , capitalism ... - Says Helen giving her head a quick scratch
            
            - So these are the things that could and can happen to people without ID's? - Says Williams with a scared face
            
            - Yeah dude ... it happens to people who haven't been registered in the system for over 400 years - Says Helen
            
            - Yeah I didn't know - Kelly says
            
            page 198
            
            - It's your quiet little life, I wouldn't let you see reality, ma'am ... but don't worry, I'll turn you into a real wolf - Says Helen smiling
            
            - It's Painful to be manipulated - says Tifany
            
            - How did you end up here? - Kelly says to Tifani
            
            - It's a long story - Says Tifany
            
            - It was nothing in life ? - Says Kelly smiling mockingly
            
            Everyone who is sitting on the logs gives a light laugh, except Tifany:
            
            - Look... everyone here is either cut out of the system because they know too much or are out of it since they were born... and you, as a scientist, should know that the life you have now is all you have. And even if you continued your shitty life earning very well as a scientist, you should know that if you die you won't take anything with you. - Tifany says in an angry tone
            
            page 199
            
            Everyone looks at Tifany and is quiet , Williams asks Helen for a cigarette :
            
            - Hey, can I have one?
            
               Helen plays for him...
            
            - Let's get supplements outside today at dawn - Says Helen
            
            - Is someone going to deliver us? - Says Kelly
            
            Tifany , Helen , and 3 others who were close to the conversation laugh
            
            - Our madam, you are quite innocent... - Says Helen
            
            - You said the government left the supplements to you. - Says Kelly
            
            - Military supplements my chayote ...- Says Helen
            
            - Ahh yes , so what do we do - Kelly says
            
            - Steal - Says Helen
            
            - Like ? - Kelly says raising her eyebrow

            Chapter 11, An improved one?
            
            - We steal from the meat carrier, food and beverage warehouses - Says Helen
            
            - Ahhh yes - Kelly says
            
            - Soon you get used to it - Says Helen
            
            - All right - Says Williams
            
            - Because it's chubby, you need to lose that belly to run faster - Says Helen
            
            - What are we going to steal today? - Kelly says with open eyes
            
            - Meat transporter train - Says Helen
            
            - All right - Says Williams
            
            page 201
            
            - You're not going with us today willians is for your own safety, but Kelly, Robins and ELEVEN are going!
            
            - Ahh yes, thank you - Williams says with some relief
            
            - You're welcome, while we're out there, take advantage and do some push-ups and jumping jacks ... you need it - Says Helen
            
            Everyone laughs lightly, except Williams, who is frowning and sitting next to Robins.
            
            - Look you guys, make your cabin ... look for things for ae, ask or exchange, here there is no sales, there is exchange. here there is no robbery, here there is no denial of things that can be shared. I'm telling you this because tonight must be pretty cold. Because firewood is missing... - Says Helen
            
            - Yes - Says Robins - Come on Williams
            
            page 202
            
            - Robins, let the chubby look for you, because soon we'll need you physically very well - Says Helen
            
            - Damn... all me - Willians says getting up and going to look for tiles and cloths something to make a tent
            
            Meanwhile across the country
            
            - It's 1 hour before our Queen's human brain is 100% recovered - Says Gabriela
            
            If an hour passes, Astaraf's brain is in a normal state... the other androids don't dare wake her up out of fear, or respect, or don't understand why she didn't wake up at the exact time she should have been woken up. So gabriela decides to wake her up:
            
            - My Queen - Gabriela says touching Astaraf who opens his eyes.
            
            Astaraf looks at her and examines her and realizes it's Gabriela
            
            page 203
            
            - Is my Queen all right? - Says Gabriela seeing Astaraf lying in front of her on a stretcher in the hospital wing
            
            - Yes I am well . - Says Astaraf lying down looking at the hospital wing of the hideout, a clean room like an ordinary doctor
            
            - My Queen, our gps had identified you on the radar, Cobra and Silva needing help on the radar and we decided to go look for you- Says Gabriela
            
            - Thank you for helping me... - Says Astaraf, says Astaraf naked
            
            - You're welcome... - Says Gabriela
            
            - Silva and Cobra were exterminated - Says Gabriela
            
            - Ahhh... yes - Says Astaraf calmly
            
            - My Queen , about Robins , he is a subject for all of us - Gabriela says with folded arms
            
            - Yes , you are right ... sometimes manipulating the media and governments are not as important things as the truth - Says Astaraf standing up
            
            - Yes, I got information from your cyber brain my Queen, I hope you don't mind. - Says Gabriela
            
            page 204
            
            - All right... did they find them? - Says Astaraf taking a pack of cigarettes on the bedside table
            
            - Yes, they are in tolouse, I sent 3 of our people there, Norberto, Alchemy and Jasmin
            
            - Great... we need more focuses on this Robins, total focus, his image is easy to be detected - Says Astaraf with Robins appearing in his Hologram with her smoking the cigarette and watching Robins
            
            - But my Queen he is one without ID now - Says Gabriela
            
            - Who took his ID? Did they kill him? They know if he's alive - Says Astaraf opening her eyes worried
            
            - I don't know and I don't know, yes he may be alive. The last information we received is that they killed two police officers in tolouse and a woman named Melissa died - Says Gabriela
            
            page 205
            
            - Well, he must be alive... the percentage is quite large. and probably became a faction. - Says Astaraf
            
            - What do you want to do? - Says Gabriela
            
            - Entering the territory of the factions... - Says Astaraf, picking up a clean combat outfit from the other bed with the cigarette in his mouth
            
            - But how ? - Says Gabriela
            
            - Making a deal... factions are not important to us. - says Astaraf putting the still lit cigarette in the ashtray and putting on the clothes
            
            - But we could go into their hideout and do a massacre and then take only the Robins alive.
            
            "No... factions are no threat to us," says Astaraf, taking his cigarette back and taking a drag.
            
            page 206
            
            - Yes, but... - Says Gabriela
            
            - No but... Says Astaraf taking one last drag and squeezing the cigarette in the ashtray - You who are already in tolouse, just find out where the factions hide, please - Says Astaraf by his hologram communicator that comes out of his left eye and seeing you have three lineage 10 androids on the gps map in tolouse
            
            The other androids receive the message and just make a sign and say "Yes my Queen" and Astaraf hangs up the communicator after the message.

            After they put paint on their face and put on a hood:
            
            - Yeah we're like clowns - says Kelly

            They walk through a corridor and then reach a courtyard, pass between the tents, Helen makes signs to some people she knows from the first courtyard, makes a military gesture to the courtyard leader who reciprocates from a distance, and they walk away. through the corridor with lights with very dim lamps... they climb a ladder that they already passed when they first arrived at the hideout and there is the old man:
            
            - Bernardo we are on a mission
            
            - It's ok, my daughter can come up
            
            they climb the ladder and wait for Helen to open the secret passage to the hideout. Helen opens the secret passage. and all go out.
            
            - Wow, it's cold out here - Kelly says warming her arms with her hands and swinging her legs from the cold
            
            - True - says Tifany doing the same
            
            - Relax , soon , we will feel warmer soon - Says Helen putting the gun bandolier on you - let 's go running , I hope you are physically prepared
            
            They run until they reach a train station
            
            page 209
            
            - Do you have money? - Says Kelly
            
            Everyone laughs and jumps the turnstile
            
            - The police won't come pick us up?
            
            - We bribe them so they can pretend we don't exist - Says Helen
            
            The train arrives and they get inside the Train. Everyone sits down, only Helen and Robins stand.
            
            - Eae Helen , how long have I not seen you ...
            
            Says another party without ID from another region
            
            - Hey how are you ? - Says Helen making a gesture of military salute
            
            - Well and you? - Says the one without ID doing the same gesture
            
            - Great , I 'm running after mine , says Helen holding the train iron to keep from falling
            
            - Yes... mission, right? -Says the no ID
            
            - Yes and you ? are you on a walk? - Says Helen sitting on the bench next to the no ID
            
            page 210
            
            - Yeah... actually I'm going south to talk to my brother
            
            After 15 minutes of conversations between Helen and the no-ID, the no-ID leaves.
            
            - Hey, all factions without ID ride the train? - Kelly says after watching Helen talk to the IDless on the train as if it were something normal
            
            - Yes hey
            
            - And the state knows about it?
            
            - Yes ... but there are many other things for the state to worry about - Helen says, biting her nail
            
            - But your faces can be identified by the terminal's cameras... don't you worry about that? - Says Kelly
            
            - Honey... for the state I've been dead for 3 years - Says Helen - And do you know how many without IDs there are in the world? millions ! The media can't show us on TV either, for supporting the extermination of those without ID's
            
            - Hmm, I see - Kelly says
            
            page 211
            
            - Let's go down - Helen says getting up
            
            They get off the train at another station, walk away and jump over the turnstile again.
            
            And they arrive at a part of the food transport metro. They walk through the dark on the subway line
            
            - Lean over and - Says Helen
            
            Everyone leans against the wall and the meter sweeps past them all
            
            - Wow , this one gave me butterflies - Kelly says
            
            - It's now you know why I didn't bring your fat friend ma'am
            
            Everyone laughs and walks until they see the meat transport train stopped.
            
            - Come on , chees - Helen says softly and making a two - hand sign with her hand
            
            There are two androids 9 making rounds on a single meat car train , Helen splits the group
            
            - ELEVEN , Robins , Athirson and Anderson over there - Says Helen low - Kelly , Tiffany , Mercedes and I around here
            
            page 212
            
            They go very slowly and climb into the meat transport car, Helen takes out the shock baton and makes a silent signal to Kelly, Tyfani and Mercedes.
            
            Until one of the androids says:
            
            - Target detected 
            
            Androide comes up behind Mercedes to attack her with a punch
            
            And at the same time ELEVEN comes and punches one of the androids that flies off the rail.
            
            Helen sees that and is scared by the strength of ELEVEN and can't move
            
            The other android Helen was going to attack turns and grabs Helen giving him a choke choke with great force , only ELEVEN arrives fast with the stun stick and touches the falling android 's neck .
            
            - THANK YOU ELEVEN ... - Says Helen
            
            Everyone is looking at ELEVEN
            
            - C'mon C'mon . Take as much as you can - Says Helen ordering to take as much meat as you can
            
            page 213
            
            ELEVEN takes a whole pig and a cow from the fridge
            
            - ELEVEN Will you bear to take this? - Says Helen
            
            - Yes
            
            Robins takes a piece of big rib
            
            - ELEVEN helps me cut these Meats here are very heavy says Kelly
            
            - All right
            
            ELEVEN Take the meat and tear it with your hands as if it were normal
            
            Once again , Everyone looks at each other 's faces
            
            - ELEVEN is improved? - Says Tifany
            
            - I don't know, if it is, it must be something new, I've never seen an expert do it - says Helen
            
            - ELEVEN cuts my meat here too - Says Helen
            
            ELEVEN goes to take Helen's knife to cut the meat, only Helen pulls out the knife and tries to attack ELEVEN, who at the same moment grabs Helen's hand and turns her on her back and puts her chin on her neck and says:
            
            page 214
            
            - I know you want to test me... but I don't know why - Says ELEVEN in Helen's ear
            
              Helen is embarrassed and at the same time feels weird ... she feels a chill that she has never felt before
            
            - Wow, I'd be horny - Says Tifany
            
            ELEVEN lets Helen go, and asks to borrow Helen's knife...Helen gives ELEVEN the knife without speaking a word
            
            ELEVEN takes the knife and makes precise cuts in the meat leaving it in different sizes.
            
            Helen and the others who are backpacking put it in the backpack
            
            - You who are without a backpack, take these strings and tie the meat like a backpack - Says Helen
            
            Tifany teaches Robins, ELEVEN and Kelly how to do it
            
            Helen takes two pieces of meat, carrying them as a backpack as does Robins, except ELEVEN who carried the cow in one hand and the pig in the other.
            
            page 215
            
            They continue on the subway, this subway passes over the river near the park where the hideout is
            
            - When I tell you to jump, you jump... Jump!
            
            Helen and the other factions play in Rio
            
            ELEVEN too , with a pig and a piece of a giant cow
            
            And they swim to the surface, Helen comes out of the water and look it's 4:30 in the morning, almost time to go back to the normal activities of people with ID
            
            they reach the surface
            
            And everyone is looking at ELEVEN
            
            - Look how strong he is - Mercedes says with a laugh
            
            - Congratulations ELEVEN , you were excellent - says Tifany
            
            - Thank you - says ELEVEN walking with a cow in one hand and a pig in the other as if it were normal
            
            - Come on - says Helen

            - Yes . Keep it - Says Helen taking a piece of meat and giving it to Bernardo
            
            - Thank you my daughter, God bless you.
            
            They turn and walk , until :

            - They're going to have a barbecue...
            
            - But of course - Helen says with a huge smile on her face
            
            And behind comes ELEVEN carrying a cow and an ox
            
            The others come and whisper:

            It is still early . But when lunchtime comes in the day , Helen says :
            
            page 217
            
            - Queue, Queue, Queue for food, Says Helen loudly
            
                People line up and get their name records from Patio 2, as only those from Patio 2 can eat the food, Helen asks ELEVEN to cut a piece of meat to give to everyone in Patio as there is a lot of meat, and ELEVEN begins to cut the meat and Helen give them:

            - Thanks Helen , thanks ... if it wasn't for you many of us would be lost .- Says the Elderly wiping his eyes with tears
            
              The meat was enough, everyone in the courtyard had people from the same family who took it 3 or 4 times per person.
            
              And there was that afternoon barbecue with drinks and music.
            
            Helem sends ELEVEN to catch the cow in the freeze. They set up a barbecue with pieces of wood between the seal and place 2 pieces of old umbrella as a skewer. Helen asks:
            - You don't have a good song do you?
            
            Page 218

            - Wow, I didn't know that in the age of the dinosaurs there was such good music! - Says Helen
            
            - A barbecue meat smell will always be good, right? - Says Kelly

            Everyone drinks while eating barbecue and listening to the songs of Williams
            
            Until it's 9 pm, Williams and Tifany are standing completely drunk with their hands on each other's shoulders trying to hold on to not fall
            
            - Look at these two - Kelly says

            - I don't drink alcoholic beverages - Say ELEVEN eating a piece of meat
            
            - A Russian who doesn't drink vodka is a miracle...- Says Helen
            
            - I'm not Russian and alcohol tastes too bad for me Helen - Says ELEVEN
            
            - All right ELEVEN , good that there is more for me and my princess - Helen says kissing Kelly's cheek
            
            The two start drinking while Williams and Tifany are clinging drunkenly to the trunk of a tree. Tifany calls Willians to go to her tent and Willians goes, dragging more goes
            
            Robins smiles seeing the scene and inadvertently looks at ELEVEN, who thought Robins was smiling at him and I smile back.

            - It was right outside ELEVEN I told you you were a Hero
            
            - Thank you Robins - Says ELEVEN chewing meat and holding another piece of meat in hand.
            
            - I hope Melissa is in a good place - Says Robins looking at the fire
            
            - What other place? When people lose the breath of life , do they go somewhere else ? - Says ELEVEN
            
            - I hope so ELEVEN , I hope so ...
            
            After the barbecue is over there are ELEVEN and Robins sitting each on a tree trunk, facing each other.
            
            - Did you like the barbecue? - Says Robins
            
            - Yes ... it was good - Says ELEVEN with a mouth smeared with meat
            
              It's already 23 and 30 and ELEVEN is the only one near the fire that is lit, Robins has already gone to sleep in a poorly made tent, which Willians made for them, but Williams is sleeping with Tifany.
            
            Page 223
            
              Helen's tent is lit, and ELEVEN looks over, and sees Kelly and Helen kissing.
            
               Until Helen is already drunk , leaves the tent to go pee and sees ELEVEN looking at her tent
            
            - Eae ELEVEN, I'll go there quickly and I'll be right back
            
            - All right...
            
            - Want to come with me? Protect me - Helen says smiling drunk
            
            - Yes - Says ELEVEN a little shy
            
            - Let's go
            
            ELEVEN Helen walks down a hallway past tents and then turns left and arrives at the same shower spot.
            
            Helen takes off her pants and starts doing needs ... Helen says :
            
            - ELEVEN, stay in front of me, so no one can see me shitting?
            
            page 224
            
            - Yes
            
              ELEVEN is facing Helen but he is excited and Helen says nothing , She looks at ELEVEN from the bottom up :
            
            - ELEVEN
            
            - Yes ?
            
            - Come closer please?
            
            - Yes !
            
            ELEVEN approaches and is very close to Helen who is sitting on the toilet doing her needs. Helen grabs him in the pants and ELEVEN likes it and leaves, Helen unzips ELEVEN's pants and ELEVEN's Penis comes out. Helen says:
            
            - You are lucky to have such a big thing, I wish I had one even if it was small - Says Helen holding ELEVEN'S penis which is big
            
            page 225
            
            - Thank you - Say ELEVEN to Helen
            
            Helen puts her mouth and says:
            
            - Is that what it feels like to suck a penis? not so bad - says Helen feeling ELEVEN's penis pulse in her mouth
            
              And Helen starts sucking slowly , shyly , and ELEVEN enjoys and feels pleasure like a human and feels Helen 's soft mouth on his cock . Until a guy comes through the corridor and sees the scene , but he can not see Helen , by ELEVEN he is in front of her , and says :
            
            
            - Bathroom is no place to have sex! - Says a man from courtyard 3
            
            - True, ELEVEN ... sorry - Says Helen
            
            - All right , I was enjoying it - Say ELEVEN
            
            - Do you want to sleep with me and Kelly today? - Says Helen
            
            - Alright... - Say ELEVEN
            
            Helen and ELEVEN return walking down the corridor past the tents of some people and families and arrive at Helen's tent:
            
            page 226
            
            - Lower your head - Says Helen half drunk
            
            Eleven lowers his head to enter the tent and closes:
            
            - Who is it says Kelly?
            
            - It's ELEVEN, the poor thing was cold outside - Says Helen half drunk
            
            - It's okay - says Kelly half drunk
            
            ELEVEN sees Kelly naked and is lying on Helen's bachelor mattress which is on the floor and is erect again. But Kelly doesn't notice.
            
            'He's going to lie down where,' says Kelly, laughing
            
            - The bed has room for three - Says Helen smiling and drunk
            
            - All right , says Kelly
            
            Kelly comes to the corner and lies on her back , Helen takes off her clothes and gets Naked , Kelly laughs and says :
            
            page 227
            
            - Are you thinking about what I'm thinking? -Kelly says
            
            - No , I just like to feel at ease in my tent - Helen says
            
            Helen gets naked and lies on her side grabbing Kelly and giving her a kiss and leaving room for ELEVEN.
            
            ELEVEN is standing erect, This time Kelly notices his erection, ELEVEN is not knowing what to do.
            
            Helen sees it and says:
            
            - ELEVEN take off your clothes too
            
            ELEVEN takes off his shirt and then his shoes and socks, then his pants, Kelly sees and says, laughing:
            
            - Wow, it's big
            
            - Yes , I had already seen it - Helen says giving Kelly a peck
            
            - I hadn't seen it - Kelly says
            
            page 228
            
            ELEVEN stands up not knowing what to do and Helen says:
            
            - Lie down here ELEVEN
            
            - All right
            
            ELEVEN lies naked and erect on Heln's side while Helen is lying on her side sucking Kelly's breasts and jerking her off. ELEVEN is standing right on the corner of the mattress on the floor and looking up listening to the noises of breast sucking and Kelly moaning
            
            - ELEVEN , you're about to fall out of bed , come here - Helen says - Lie down as I'm on your side is the only way
            
            Kelly giggles
            
            ELEVEN lies on his side and feels his cock brush Helen's vagina, who purposely throws her ass back. Until Helen grabs ELEVEN's penis and puts it inside her vagina, Helen lets out a loud moan and squeezes Kelly's breasts tightly, Kelly realizes that Helen has been penetrated by ELEVEN and starts kissing Helen on the mouth at the same time. ELEVEN will naturally loosen up and start to pump Helen with force and Helen starts to give herself completely :
            
            Page 229
            
            - That ELEVEN fucks your little bitch - Helen says forcing a very feminine and sexy mouth
            
            Kelly giggles and says:
            
            - After you try our hero a little
            
            Helen doesn't even hear what Kelly says, she's just feeling ELEVEN get her in fast and with force like a machine, And Helen is drooling all over Kelly and moaning very loudly, Helen is enjoying a lot. Kelly says:
            
            - Our low moans say to Helen
            
            But Helen is already in the moon world. Helen had never had sex with a man despite being beautiful, and she was also more attracted to the female sex. So he thinks it's okay to moan out loud having sex with a man for the first time.
            
            After about 15 minutes getting into this frequency Helen has several multiple orgasms shaking while ELEVEN gets into high gear and Helen passes out from the pleasure. Kelly notices and says:
            
            page 230
            
            - ELEVEN to - Kelly says
            
            eleven immediately to
            
            Kelly starts to laugh and not believe that Helen has entered a state of sexual trance and is drooling and shaking and with her eyes closed and talking softly:
            
            - ELEVEN, my turn - Kelly says
            
            - All right - Say ELEVEN 
            
            Kelly pulls Helen aside who is still in a trance , and asks ELEVEN for help , ELEVEN puts helen on the end of the bed and Kelly is in the middle and realizes that ELEVEN is completely soaked and the part where Helen was too , But she lies down same way as Helen was on the side. ELEVEN threads it slowly and increases the speed and Kelly moans loudly and the clapping and moaning noise
            
            The noise is so much that some people who are awake think "wow this guy is a machine ein" ... and others wake up and are laughing knowing that the moaning and clapping of hands comes from Helen's tent and that Helen is a lesbian.
            
            Page 231
            
            ELEVEN Takes Kelly with strength and speed and from the side, Kelly has multiple orgasms and enjoys countless times, after ELEVEN put in for many minutes, Kelly is also in a sexual trance and ELEVEN keeps getting into it. Helen notices that Kelly is practically passed out and says:
            
            - ELEVEN , stop please - Says Helen
            
            - All right
            
            Helen lights a cigarette and asks:
            
            - Would you like ?
            
            - No - Say ELEVEN
            
            - Wow... it was the best sex of my life - Says Helen looking at a yellow star on the roof of the tent
            
            - Is it? - says ELEVEN
            
            page 232
            
            - Yes, you fuck like a machine, fight with the strength of a machine... but it's not one, Wolf didn't identify you...- Says Helen in bed with Kelly biting her lips in sexual ecstasy.- You made me I have a super orgasm ELEVEN, I never thought that having sex with a man could be so good - Says Helen
            
            - Thank you - Say ELEVEN
            
                Until night turns and it's 5:30 in the morning... Helen wakes up first and orders ELEVEN to get up the two get dressed. Helen leaves first and then calls ELEVEN and says:
            
            - Don't tell anyone what happened yesterday and give a peck on the cheek ... leave before they see you here - Says Helen looking at the other tents
            
            ELEVEN leaves the tent and sits on the log, ELEVEN couldn't sleep because he was too energized. Helen sits on the other side of the log and turns on one of the lights near the tent Helen lights a fire and starts making coffee , ELEVEN asks if she wants help :
            
            page 233
            
            - Want help Helen?
            
            - Yes ELEVEN stir the coffee here for me please? - Says Helen with the blanket wrapped around her to escape the cold
            
            - Yes, I move - Say ELEVEN going to help her
            
            ELEVEN stirs the coffee next to Helen until the spoon drops and Helen bends down in front of ELEVEN and her legs tremble and she feels a shiver from her spine to her neck, she takes it and hands it to ELEVEN and goes to the the other side and sits and watches ELEVEN and thinking:
            
            - (What is this, am I in love? Is it really that good to have sex with men? Probably not, this ELEVEN should be every woman's dream, I don't know, but am I really falling in love with a man? what was that now , i got goose bumps just feeling him behind me
            
            page 234
            
            Time passes until everyone wakes up little by little:
            
            - Good morning Tifany - Say ELEVEN and Helen
            
            - Good morning... - Tifany says with a grumpy face
            
            - It is good too ?
            
            - No... I don't know what happened, I wake up and look to the side and there's the chubby naked one in my tent
            
            Helen starts laughing and ELEVEN smiles.
            
            - You and he got drunk yesterday, took pictures and everything in his hologram - Says Helen
            
            - I know, but I don't remember anything - Tifany says
            
            1 hour later Robins appears near Helen's tent and says:
            
            - Good morning - Says Robins
            
            - Good morning - Everyone says
            
            page 235
            
            - The night at Helen's tent was wonderful, right? - Says Robins giving a smile
            
            And Helen frowns, until Helen sees ELEVEN and gets shy and turns away. Tifany realizes and says:
            
            - Hey ... what happened - Tifany says with a shocked face
            
            - No biggie... - Says Helen smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee
            
            - I've never seen anyone clap so many hands moaning - Robins says laughing
            
            - Look at Robins, you respect me - Helen says seriously
            
            - You're pretty grumpy, I'm just kidding - Robins says smiling
            
            - I understand you , I told you it's a good experience to clap Helen - Says Tifany laughing
            
            - The want to know ... I'm going to rest a little more - Says Helen entering the tent with a very angry face
            
            Kelly is awake and asks:
            
            Page 236
            
            - How did you manage to get up? - Says Kelly
            
            - I'm ex military, I think that's it - Helen says kissing Kelly on the cheek and caressing her other cheek
            
            - Do you remember yesterday? - Says Kelly smiling
            
            - Yes ... and you ? - Says Helen looking at Kelly's face
            
            - I just remember ELEVEN getting into me hard and fast and me feeling things I've never felt before - Kelly says looking up
            
            - Wow... so he's different from other men? - Says Helen
            
            'Very much,' says Kelly, laughing.
            
            Helen laughs too and says:
            
            - Whew , what a relief ... - Helen says lighting a cigarette
            
            - Why ? - Kelly says looking at the star on the roof of the tent
            
            - I thought all men were like ELEVEN in bed... - Says Helen
            
            Page 237
            
            - What in bed? nanãninano ... neither do androids have sex like ELEVEN - says Kelly
            
            - He's special ? Is it a demigod who fell into the world - Says Helen lying next to helen looking at the star on the ceiling ta tent
            
            - Yeah... I hope so! - Says Kelly
            
            Meanwhile... on the other side of the country:
            
            - Found them? - Says Astaraf
            
            - No , but we received an interesting news - Norberto says
            
               Norberto sends all the information about the meat transport company to send to the police records of images from the eye camera of the android who was shot down on the tracks. the other android is fine, but something happened that didn't make it record the record anymore as it was happening before
            
            Page 238
            
               Norberto sends Astaraf a video of a man carrying a pig and a cow in his hand in the image record
            
            - Humans don't have that strength? Says Gabriela
            
            - Exactly - Says Astaraf
            
            - But maybe he's an improved one - Says Gabriela
            
            - Improved? Really, those without ID's don't work and don't leave androids in their factions - Says Astaraf
            
            - And they won't be TV news because they have no ID's - says Gabriela
            
            - Exactly ! - Says Astaraf sitting with posture and with her hands on her knees looking at the document records of a police station
            
            - What will we do ? - Says Gabriela
            
            - You who are in Normandy... Don't let the police bother us or interfere with our mission - If necessary kill the police, but threaten them first. or easier, bribe them
            
            page 239
            
            - Isn't it better to send more of us? - Says Gabriela
            
            - Not ! Leave it to me, I'll join the 3 who are in Caen, you stay here. - Says Astaraf.
            
            Astaraf climbs a load-carrying rail that takes her towards the tolouse.
            
            Alchemy is already in Normandy and on top of a building from far away some men come out of a place on the ground, near Alchemy Park, zoom in and decide to share information.
            
            - I have something interesting - Says Alchemy to all androids
            
            - Yes - Says Astaraf
            
            - See
            
               Alchemy passes a video through his holographic left eye to all androids
            
            - It's a hideout - Norberto says he's in another place nearby
            
            - Yeah - says Astaraf , on top of the freight transport train , lying down and leaning on top of the train , with the trees passing by and seeing the beautiful day that is ... - do nothing ! wait for me to arrive. - Says Astaraf

            Is he an upgrade?
            
            And the other androids that are in Normandy say:
            
            - Yes my Queen
            
            Alchemy sits on the Ferris wheel and looks down on the place, waiting for Astaraf to arrive.
            
            Meanwhile , inside the hideout
            
            - Ae Wolf... have you ever seen a new boy who's there with Helen in courtyard 2 ? - Says the Owner of Patio 1
            
            - Yes, why? - says Wolf reading some records
            
            - That boy is very strong! He was carrying a cow and a pig in each hand...
            
            - Look André, if he were an android I would have detected him with my eyes that you can tell if he is or not. - Says Wolf
            
            - Dude , did you really see it ? if I were you I'd go back there and have a conversation with Helen and this guy... maybe you haven't seen it with your x-ray ability on this improved guy or android, whatever it is - Says André
            
            page 241
            
            - You guys from patio 1 and 3 are dying of envy - says Wolf laughing - I heard that they had a bigger barbecue there in patio 2
            
            - Envy ... envy ... beware Wolf, I gave you a warning, I'm going back to my place, good morning - Says André saying goodbye
            
            - I think I'll have to go check it out on patio 2 - Says Wolf sitting in the chair with his feet propped up on a table smoking a cigar.
            
               Wolf goes alone to Patio 2 and there are ELEVEN, Robins, Tifany, Kelly, Helen, Williams, but about 4 people. Wolf arrives talking to everyone as usual , waving :
            
            - Here comes Wolf - Says Tifany
            
            - Hi, good morning you guys - Says Wolf
            
            - Good morning - everyone says
            
            - Stand up - says Helen in a salute
            
            - No, Helen, please... this is not the army
            
            page 242
            
            Everyone gives a light laugh, because Helen was the only one who made the saluting gesture
            
            - I miss it - says Helen
            
            - Yeah, me too - Says Wolf pressing a button on the side of his temple to see people in an x-ray mode
            
            Wolf looks at ELEVEN and looks again , and sees human organs all human to a beating heart , but much brighter than the rest , their bones and everything is extremly bright like gold reflected by the sun . Wolf has never seen anything like this , he has seen x - rays of 10 androids which inside are completely different from ordinary humans except for the brain .
            
            - What is it? - Say ELEVEN to Wolf
            
            - Nothing, nothing - Says Wolf
            
            - Wolf a cat ate your tongue? - says Tifany
            
            page 243
            
            - No... - Wolf says turning his x-ray capability on and off just to make sure what he's seeing
            
              Wolf sees something on ELEVEN's x-ray that looks like an eye on his forehead, and on ELEVEN's temple, veins are very visible and glowing and entering that eye.
            
            Wolf begins to think that ELEVEN is some improved millionaire who has gone broke and gone crazy trying to improve himself , but he says nothing and shuts down his x - ray ability .
            
            - Is he an android 10? - Does Melissa say?
            
            - No ... he's different, but he's not an android - says Wolf scratching his head
            
            - Different ? - Says Tifany
            
            - Yes - says Wolf rubbing his hand over his lips
            
            - How different ? - Says Helen
            
            Page 244
            
            - He's all shiny, all the same, his organs, his heart, his bones - Says Wolf
            
            - Hmm didn't know - Kelly says
            
            - That's right , this guy maybe he was some tycoon who went bankrupt got rich and this one here , without ID ... - Says Wolf
            
            - Tycoon ...- Says Tifany
            
            - You had sex with a tycoon Helen? - Says Melissa laughing
            
            - Helen... huh, aren't you a lesbian? - Says Wolf
            
            - There's always a first time for everything - says Helen
            
            - Great ... I'm going, stay well - says Wolf walking and passing his hand over the head of a little boy who was sitting in another tent.
            
            - Uii, ELEVEN is different - Tifany says mockingly - because to eat Helen the guy has to be really badass
            
            page 245
            
            Helen looks up rolling her eyes and with her arms crossed in an expression of someone pretending not to care what happened
            
            - Look at Tifany... I don't understand why you think Helen like that - Kelly says
            
            - I'm being ironic... - Says Tifany
            
            - It's true, you can't stand a fuss - Willians says defending Tifany
            
            - You're defending her because you ate her yesterday, right? - Says Kelly
            
            everyone laughs
            
            - I don't remember anything, so it didn't happen - Says Tifany
            
            - Well ... I don't remember either - Willians says - I woke up thinking I had died and I left the tent thinking that here was hell
            
            everyone laughs again
            
            Page 246
            
              The day goes by and the pig goes to the coals, and they have a pork barbecue, and everyone on the patio eats the meat that is distributed to two people on top of a piece of wood.
            
            Meanwhile a powerful being comes closer and closer
            
              Astaraf arrives at the place where Alchemy is and sits beside her on the Ferris wheel:
            
            'Where's the rat's nest,' says Astaraf, lighting up a cigarette
            
            - There my queen , says Alchemy passing the precise location
            
            - Thank you - Says Astaraf
            
            - And now ? are we going to invade or wait? - Says Alchemy
            
            - I have a plan, I'll put you inside without ID - Says Astaraf
            
            Page 247
            
            - Okay - Says Alchemy - I'm already without ID
            
            - Great , we need the normal clothes of people who do not have so much financial conditions ... - Says Astaraf smoking a cigarette
            
            - Yes, my Queen - Says Alchemy jumping off the Ferris wheel
            
              Alchemy walks around the neighborhood and stays in a hidden corridor until he pulls a woman into a hidden place and hangs her so hard that she breaks her neck. She removes the woman's clothes and puts them on. Alchemy is now wearing a red blouse and green denim shorts.
            
            - I already got it - says Alchemy through the communicator
            
            - All right , you can come - Says Astaraf sitting on the Ferris wheel
            
            Alchemy arrives and it's already 19 and 30, Alchemy is dressed differently.
            
            - Come with me - Says Astaraf
            
            Astaraf and Alchemy jump off the Ferris wheel again and walk around a certain spot in the park. Astaraf sees grass and sand and says:
            
            page 248
            
            - Oops , earth , come here ...
            
            Astaraf grabs Alchemy by the hair and drags his face into the dirt
            
            Alchemy tries to react, but Astaraf says:
            
            - The dumb is for the plane...
            
            And Drags Alchemy's face back into the mud
            
            - All right - Says Alchemy
            
            After 2 minutes alchemy is completely dirty , scratched and with the blouse torn and Astaraf says :
            
            - How stupid are you sometimes huh?
            
            - Each one of us has his own way of thinking and that's what makes us free - Says Alchemy
            
            - Okay ... the plan now is the following you will be lying there close , not near the hideout , but about 30 meters , so they do not notice .
            
            Page 249
            
            - All right - Says Alchemy
            
            Alchemy does everything Astaraf said , until at 7:30 a young man from Courtyard 3 goes to find something outside and sees Alchemy lying down and quite dirty , he arrives and talks to Alchemy .
            
            - Hey the lady
            
            - Hmm, argh
            
            - What happened ?
            
            - They tried to kill me - Says Alchemy getting up so the boy doesn't try to carry her on her arm, because that way she would deliver her real weight, which is 200 kilos.
            
            - Wow you're pretty wounded - Says the boy - What's your name?
            
            - Alchemy and yours?
            
            - My name is Angelo
            
               Angelo is a boy of about 1.70 in height, white and with black curly hair, with the appearance of a young boy of someone with 18 years. Angelo drags her to the hiding place with Alchemy putting her feet on the ground to trick Angelo , so he thinks he is carrying her on his shoulder , the stairs arrive and they go down
            
            page 250
            
            and they are in patio 1 and they are walking around the patio and they hear the people talking:
            - Who is this? ,- poor wound!,- Maybe he survived the death !, - That must be a runaway whore ,- Here is full of runaway whores too , - exactly .
            
            Arrives at patio 2 and they walk with some people also talking about Alchemy , until they pass near Helen 's hut , Alchemy looks and sees Robins , and identifies him , and continues being dragged by Angelo , finally arrives at her tent , and goes there inform the Chief of Courtyard 3 that you have arrived with Alchemy.
            
              He enters the tent of the Chief of the Courtyard and says:
            
            - Good morning Dominic
            
            - Good morning - Says Dominique reading a book, Dominique is an old man with white hair, about 1.60 tall, dressed in a black blouse and sitting in a chair with his feet supported on another chair.
            
            page 251
            
            - Look, I brought new people here! okay ? - Says Angelo with his hand on his head
            
            - And the others were on the mission? - Says Dominic
            
            - Yes... - Says Angelo
            
            - Is it a man or a woman?
            
            - Woman !
            
            - Where ?
            
               Angelo leaves the tent along with Dominique and shows Alchemy her sitting in a place lit with a dim lamp, Dominique strains her vision and doesn't see her, so decides to go to her. Dominique arrives and says:
            
            - Wow, she's dirty huh?
            
            - Yes - says Angelo
            
            - Take her to bathe boy ...and something for her to eat, let's go - Says Dominique
            
            - Yes sir
            
            page 252
            
            Angelo takes one of his towels and calls Alchemy to go with you:
            
            - Alchemy come with me, I'll show you the shower
            
            - Yes
            
              Alchemy gets up and follows Angelo dragging her foot, pretending this wound, passing the tents with dim lamps on and people looking at her.
            
            Until they reach the shower:
            
            - It's here, just turn this valve that drops water through the pipe - Says Angelo
            
               Alchemy takes off her clothes in front of Angelo and he turns his gaze upwards , Alchemy turns on the shower and turns his back and Angelo sees Alchemy 's beautiful black body in the water and she turns to face him and he sees alchemy 's breasts very hard and in place and look away again. Alchemy is a black android with curly hair and very beautiful, Young Angelo thought that he would never hear women with such body beauty. Alchemy notices angelo with red cheeks looking up and says:
            
            page 253
            
            - Hi, I'm done, is there a problem?
            
            - No-No
            
            Says Angelo giving a slight shy stutter.
            
            Angelo gives the towel in Alchemy's hands for her to dry off, they dry themselves and wrap themselves in the towel and go back until they sit down again on Angelo's tent cloth.
            
            Angelo goes to Dominique and gets new clothes for Alquímia, who is now dressed in the clothes of the factions without ID's
            
            But then Dominique arrives , looks and says :
            
            - What a good bath doesn't do
            
            And then she uses an ID detector and sends her shows her pulse:
            
            -Are you really one with no ID, what were you?
            
            - A whore!
            
            page 254
            
            - Ahh yes it's alright ... - Says Dominique .- You are a very beautiful black lady
            
            - Thanks
            
            - What is your name ?
            
            - Alchemy
            
            - Ahh yes, that reminds Alchemy - Says Dominique with a laugh - Have a good day Alchemy
            
            - Thank you too 
            
               Alchemy saw Robins and didn't think it would be so easy.
            
            - Here we can walk freely from one side to the other? - Says Alchemy
            
            - Yes - Angelo says sitting next to her leaning his head against the wall - why do you want to know ?
            
            - Nothing, I had no ID but I worked out of here
            
            page 255
            
              Hours pass of conversation and from 12.30 pm lunch time:
            
            - Are you hungry? - Says Angelo
            
            - No, not yet and you?
            
            - A lot - says Angelo
            
            - And you don't have food with you?
            
            - Not ! - Says Angelo
            
            - Because in the other courtyard they are roasting something over the coals and not here?
            
            - It's because, each patio gets enough for its patio. And each patio has an owner ... -Says Angelo curling his hair
            
            - Oh yes , and they can not share food ?
            
            - Only with people from the patio itself - Says Angelo
            
            - Wouldn't that be selfish? - Says Alchemy
            
            - I don't know, it's always been like that and I don't know the meaning of the word selfishness - Angelo says, lowering his head
            
            page 256
            
            Alchemy is quiet and looks around and sees hungry people , children , old people , licking their lips , because of the smell of meat coming from the courtyard 2
            
            - People here die of hunger, right? - Says Alchemy
            
            - Yes almost every week - Says Angelo
            
            - You have parents ?
            
            - Not ...
            
            - They died ?
            
            - Yes
            
            - From what?
            
            - My father on a mission to hunt for food and my mother and sister hungry - says Angelo with tears running down his eyes looking down
            
            Alchemy keeps looking at Angelo crying with tears running down her eyes , without making any expression , but seems to feel sorry for Angelo
            
            Page 257
            
            Until those who went to get food return with a bunch of boxes of peanut packages, stolen from a warehouse and distributed. Angelo takes 2 packages for himself and 2 packages for Alchemy and hands her and sits down.
            
            Angelo opens his package with the knife , and Alchemia keeps hers
            
            - Still not hungry? - Says Angelo
            
            - No... yesterday I ate a lot - says Alchemy
            
            - Ah yes
            
            - Whores eat well - Says Alchemy again
            
                 Angelo opens a smile:
            
            - Have you ever had a boyfriend? - Says Angelo
            
            - I'm a whore - Says Alchemy
            
            - Already loved someone Alchemy - Says Angelo eating peanuts one at a time
            
            page 258
            
            - No, not yet and you? Have you ever had a girlfriend? a love? - Says Alchemy
            
            - No, says Angelo, not yet
            
            - Are you a virgin ? - Says Alchemy without expressions
            
            - Yeah, I won't lie to you, I am! I've been in the kisses you know, but I've never tried anything else - Says Angelo
            
            - But you are someone acceptable in society, you are a handsome boy says Alchemy
            
            - Thanks
            
            - You were very kind to me, if you want I can satisfy you sexually - Says Alchemy
            
            - Really? - Says Angelo opening his eyes
            
            - Yes , just close the curtain - Says Alchemy
            
              Angelo's heart pounded as if it were going to explode, not least because he found Alchemy very attractive. Angelo closes the curtain and stands still , Alchemy tells Angelo to lie down :
            
            page 259
            
            - Lay down
            
            Angelo lies down on his cardboard, Alchemy takes off his shirt, then his pants and then his shoes and socks and sits on top of Angelo, with his knees on the floor. Alchemy says:
            
            - I'm getting so wet
            
            So she gives the command to lubricate her vagina. She unzips Angelo's pants and takes out the young Angelo's erect penis and shoves it inside her vagina and rides forward, Angelo sees Alchemy's breasts sway, her curves, her beautiful face and her hair falling over her, feeling enough pleasure penetrating her. Angelo squeezes Alchemy's breasts as she rides moaning, and Angelo's friends from Courtyard 3 listen and say:
            
            - Aeee you're losing the gourd, congratulations Angelo
            
            - Is it Angelo? Boy like that he's going to get this woman pregnant - Says an old man
            
            After about 8 minutes, Angelo doesn't resist and ejaculates, ejaculates a lot inside Alchemy says:
            
            - I'm so exhausted
            
            I'm so exhausted it's a command for your vagina to stop lubricating
            
            Alchemy lies down beside Angelo:
            
            - If you want to be lying on top of me, I'll let you - Angelo says, stroking Alchemy's face
            
            - I can't lie on you, I'm a whore- Says Alchemy
            
            page 260
            
            - You are so beautiful... - Says Angelo
            
            - Thank you - Says Alchemy
            
            Alchemy says this because it's so heavy, and the way she had sex with Angelo was precisely calculated so that she didn't land full weight on him or hurt him.
            
            - No need to say thanks, today is perhaps the best day of my life - Angelo says with a smile on his face
            
            - Because today would be the best day of your life?
            
            - Because I'm lucky to have met you, such a beautiful black woman - Says Angelo
            
            - Thanks
            
            - Why do you always thank you for everything? - Says Angelo caressing Alchemy's face
            
            page 261
            
            - Because I have an education - Says Alchemy tries to make an ironic look, trying to imitate humans
            
            - Alright... you should stop thanking so much - Says Angelo
            
            - Why ? - Says Alchemy
            
            - You don't need to thank me for anything - Angelo says with one hand on Alchemy's leg and the other behind his own head lying down
            
              Until a guy who has just come back outside comes and goes to Angelo's cabin he pulls it open and looks and says:
            
            - I'll talk to you later, lucky
            
            and closes the curtain of Angelo's hut. Angelo smiles and says, I'm really lucky and sits next to Alchemy and comes over and starts kissing her on the mouth, and they stay kissing for a few minutes
            
            page 262
            
            - How well you kiss - Says Angelo
            
            - You too say - Alchemy
            
            Alquímia and Angelo are having sex until around 18 and 30 at night, until Angelo begins to sleep tired, with Alchemia lying on his side. Alchemy uses his machine ability and sees that Angelo is already in REM sleep. So Alchemia gets dressed sitting next to Angelo without making a sound, after Alchemia gets up and walks to the hall bathroom. And he uses the communicator with Astaraf and says:
            
            
            - Robins is here, and he's fine. What do I do ? - Says Alchemy through the communicator
            
            - Wait . At 2 o'clock in the morning you call me again - Says Astaraf
            
            - All right - Says Alchemy
            
            page 263
            
            Alchemy returns to Angelo's tent, who is awake
            
            "You don't sleep," says Angelo?
            
            - Yes , but it 's still early - Alchemy says lying down next to Angelo and stroking his hair
            
              Angelo picks up a wristwatch that is on his side and sees the time, it's 19 and 12
            
            - It really is still early - Says Angelo
            
            - Yes - Says Alchemy
            
            - Wow I'm so exhausted, you broke up with me - Says Angelo smiling
            
            Time passes, Angelo lies down again. It's 23 and 23 , Alchemy gets up and goes for a walk in another courtyard
            
            She goes to the patio that is ELEVEN and the others
            
            page 264
            
            There she is, she doesn't need to make much effort to find them, because Helen's tent is on the side of the path that connects to the corridor of other courtyards. Alchemy comes walking calmly, and sees a bonfire just beside the path lit and is there ELEVEN sitting alone looking at the fire with his arms crossed. ELEVEN sees Alchemy, and she looks at him too, however, Alchemy has not activated her ability to see x-ray to know if ELEVEN is also a machine.
            
            Alíssia arrives and sits beside ELEVEN at the fire trying to find out information:
            
            - Hi - says ELEVEN
            
            - Hi - Says Alchemy
            
            - Nice to meet you, I'm ELEVEN
            
            page 265
            
            - Pleasure, I'm Alchemy
            
            - You're new here, right? - It says ELEVEN
            
            - Exactly - Says Alchemy
            
            - Yes , I saw you being dragged by a young man from courtyard 3 earlier today
            
            - Exactly
            
            - You were what out there?
            
            - I was a whore, and you?
            
            - I'm a hero - Says ELEVEN
            
            - Hero? - Says Alchemy
            
            - Yes , that's what I was told - Say ELEVEN picking up a piece of stick from the ground and analyzing
            
            - Are there heroes? - Says Alchemy looking at the fire
            
            - I think whoever saves people from bad people or androids is a hero, right?- Says ELEVEN
            
            page 266
            
            - Oh yes. Have you ever faced any android 10 in combat?
            
            - No, they are cowards
            
            - Why do you think that ?
            
            - Because they kill people
            
            - Have you ever killed anyone?
            
            - Yes !
            
            - For what reason?
            
            - Justice - Says ELEVEN
            
            - Android 10 also kill for justice
            
            - Why do you think that ?
            
            - The men who were going to kill you were police, right?
            
            - How do you know that? - Says ELEVEN with one eyebrow raised
            
            - I know many things ... Police they do their own justice, as well as androids 10
            
            Page 267
            
            - Do you think killing someone for no reason is justice? - Says ELEVEN looking at the fire
            
            - As far as I know the androids 10 always kill someone for some reason - says Alchemy looking at the fire
            
            - What reason ?
            
            - For reasons of their own, or because the human race is too selfish - Says Alchemy
            
            - Do you think us selfish?
            
            - Yes , we created the androids to have more powers than others - Says Alchemy pretending to be a human
            
            - Look this makes sense - Says ELEVEN
            
            - Well, it's ELEVEN, it makes a lot of sense - Says Alchemy
            
            Alchemy sees on her android watch that only she sees and it's 1 and 58:
            
            page 268
            
            - I'm going ELEVEN, see you later
            
            - Stay with God - says ELEVEN
            
            Alchemy goes to the bathroom and communicates with Astaraf:
            
            - My queen
            
            - Yes
            
            - What are the orders
            
            - Kill someone, take the clothes and bring me, says Astaraf:
            
            - All right !
            
            Alchemy arrives at Angelo's tent and looks at him, and thinks:
            
            (- Hmm you don't)
            
            Alchemy goes to Dominique's tent, who is sleeping, and takes a blouse and pants, without killing Dominique, and leaves, without being seen by anyone.
            
            Alchemy goes to the exit, but the stairs are being watched by Bernardo:
            
            page 269
            
            - Hi, you are the young woman brought here today, right? - Says Bernard
            
            - Yes
            
            Alchemy without much time for conversation hangs Bernardo with just one hand, Bernardo tries to scream for help, but Alchemy squeezes Bernardo so hard that it's no use Bernardo trembles in Alicia's hands and she examines him and sees that he is lifeless, she hide his body in a dark corner and go upstairs. Alchemy comes out of hiding and goes to Astaraf with the clothes:
            
            - Here's your robes
            
            - Excellent
            
            - Let's go back
            
              Alchemy and Astaraf enter back into hiding. The owner of the first patio sees them and says:
            
            - What were you doing outside?
            
            - Dominique asked to find out something - Says Alchemy
            
            - Oh yes, alright then
            
            Unfortunately we can't let you live, you're too powerful!
            
            page 270
            
               Astaraf and Alchemy walk past Helen's tent and see ELEVEN sitting looking at the fire and Ascena to Alchemy who also Rises Eleven, Astaraf says to Alchemy:
            
            - Wasn't he the improved one we saw carrying a cow and a pig in the video?
            
            - Yes
            
            - Is he an Android? - Says Astaraf
            
            - I don't know, but he's very weird - Says Alchemy
            
            - How weird?
            
            - He was saying he was a hero
            
              Astaraf stops and feels dizzy and remembers Robins saying the same thing to her and says:
            
            - Are you feeling well? - Says Alchemy
            
            - Come I want to meet this hero - Says Astaraf
            
            They walk back down the path to the fire, each sitting on one side of ELEVEN
            
            Page 271
            
            - Hi ELEVEN , this is ...
            
            - I'm Clementina, my pleasure ELEVEN
            
            Says Astaraf changing the name , as she is well known by her real name
            
            - Pleasure, Clementina - Says ELEVEN - Is everything okay with you?
            
            - Yes , we are not sleepy and we just came to talk - Says Alchemy
            
            - ELEVEN, do you remember who you were a while ago? to have a family or something? - Says Astaraf looking at the fire
            
            - Not
            
            - Oh yes , do you believe in these manipulators ? - Says Astaraf
            
            - Who do you think is manipulating me? - It says ELEVEN
            
            page 272
            
            Astaraf reaches his ear and says:
            
            - Robins
            
            She says very softly against his ear and then imitates you Robins
            
            - Hello ELEVEN, you are a hero
            
            ELEVEN gets scared and says:
            
            - What do you mean, what are you? - Says ELEVEN looking at Astaraf scared
            
            - I'm like you, they will use you and then try to kill you. You are an experiment ELEVEN, you are an Android - Says Astaraf - You are a Robins experiment, a puppet of him
            
            ELEVEN is in shock... puts his hands on his head and begins to realize that Astaraf is telling the truth, remembering this one in the mirrored room tied to chains. ELEVEN thinks about suicide, as he is programmed to stop committing suicide if he discovers it is an experiment or an android done in the laboratory.
            
            Page 273
            
            Astaraf takes Robins hands and says:
            
              - Do not do this ...
            
            But ELEVEN uses force too
            
            - I have to do - says ELEVEN
            
            - He is strong , hack his thoughts - Says Astaraf to Alchemy doing a lot of strength
            
            - I'll take care of it - says Alchemy, who puts his finger in ELEVEN's ear and comes out smart wires and in a minute Alchemy hacks his command of suicidal thoughts. ELEVEN is already calm and says:
            
            - Am I an experiment? - Says ELEVEN with tears in his eyes
            
            - Yes , you were made in a laboratory just like the two of us - Says Astaraf
            
            - You are what? - Says ELEVEN with a curious look
            
            - I'm an Android 10, and my real name is Astaraf, pleasure ELEVEN
            
            page 274
            
              ELEVEN hears Astaraf's name and thinks about attacking her, but ELEVEN's curious side wants to hear her, and ELEVEN says:
            
            - Pleasure Astaraf
            
            - You are the first of the eleventh lineage, I'm impressed... you cry like humans and you have a body system identical to humans, but your organs are cast gold, your bones are graphene and gold and I liked that one eye on his forehead - Says Astaraf using his vision X-ray - That's why his name is ELEVEN , The first of the eleventh lineage of Androids
            
            ELEVEN sits still with his arms crossed looking into the fire and remembering being tied to a chain, in a room with mirrored walls, remembering Robins' name and realizing that he had no friends, because friends don't lie to others that way 
            
            - I want to leave here - says ELEVEN
            
            - Wait, I want to meet Robins and get answers - says Astaraf
            
            - All right - Say ELEVEN
            
            page 275
            
            Time passes and it is already 5:30 in the morning, and the 3 are looking at the fire. Until Helen wakes up and sees the 3 , until she comes closer yawning and notices that who is next to ELEVEN at the fire is Astaraf and says :
            
            - My God
            
            - Quiet , or I'll kill you all , and there will be no stone unturned , Sentesse ai - Says Astaraf
            
            Helen , had thought of running back to the tent , but thought of the children who live in her yard and sit on the log
            
            - Pleasure madam - Says Helen - How did you get in here ?
            
            - It was pretty easy - Says Astaraf taking a cigarette from his pocket
            
            - Can I have one - Says Helen
            
              Astaraf takes a cigarette from the pack and tosses it to Helen. the cigarette falls on the floor
            
            page 276
            
            - I'll get a lighter
            
            - No , rise on the bonfire - Says Astaraf
            
            - Alright... I rise on the bonfire
            
            Helem gets up and lights his cigarette on the fire
            
            - Look, what do you want here? - Says Helen
            
            - Robins
            
            - The black guy?
            
            - Yes - Says Astaraf
            
            - What do you want with him?
            
            - Sometimes curiosity kills the cat - Says Astaraf
            
            - It's okay, I don't want to know
            
            - I'll make the coffee - Say ELEVEN

              Until Angelo looks to one side of his cardboards on the floor and doesn't see Alchemy and decides to take a walk, first Angelo goes to courtyard 4 and 5... then he thinks and says to himself:
            
            - I better go to patio 1 or ask Bernardo what happened
            
            Angelo walks and passes through patio 4, 3 and arrives at patio 2 and walks and sees people talking and notices Alquímia there.
            
            - Hi, Good morning Alchemy, Good morning Helen, Good morning Guys.
            
            - Good Morning
            
            They all say except Astaraf that he is smoking and then he looks at Angelo and says:
            
            - Sit down and kid
            
            - Alright, I'll sit down
            
            - Po Angelo, just now that you come to me? - Says Helen putting her hand on her head
            
            - Ahh yes, I was looking for Alchemy - Says Angelo
            
            - I'm here, says Alchemy, forcing a smile
            
            Page 278
            
            - I know my beautiful
            
            - Shut up - Says Astaraf
            
            - Why ? who are you ? I never saw you .
            
            The Owner of Patio 1 comes down the hall at the same moment and says to Helen:
            
            - Helen the Bernard is dead, with a broken neck
            
            - What ? - Says Helen pretending to be surprised
            
            - Yes, someone killed him...
            
            Astaraf stands up and points his finger in the direction of the Owner of Courtyard 1 of his finger silently comes out a 5000 volt stun bullet and kills him instantly. Everyone is scared. Angelo threatens to get up to run and Astaraf says:
            
            - If you run, you die - Astaraf says pointing his finger at Angelo
            
            Angelo is quiet and shaking with fear
            
            - Alchemy, take the man's body out of there
            
            page 279
            
            Alchemy gets up and takes the body of the owner of Patio 1 and leaves him beside the fire. Angelo is impressed with Alchemy's strength and realizes that she is also an android and says:
            
            - How could I believe you... - Says Angelo
            
            - Unfortunately sometimes we have to lie to get things - says Alchemy sitting down again next to ELEVEN
            
            Time passes and Robins wakes up and walks:
            
            - Look who's coming... - Says Alchemy.
            
            Astaraf turned his back to pretend he was taking something, so Robins wouldn't see his face. When Robins gets close he sees blood marks on the ground and when he stands in front of the fire he says:
            
            - Good Morning
            
            Everyone looks at Robins and at the same moment Astaraf turns and says:
            
            page 280
            
            - Hello Robins, your heroine is here
            
            Robins sees Astaraf, who says:
            
            - If I run I'll kill everyone in this place ... heard Robins
            
            - All right, all right ... that would happen sooner or later - Says Robins
            
            - Sit there and tell me everything
            
            Robins tells all about how Astaraf and the other 10 androids were made , the companies that participated , everything
            
            - Hmm, I haven't read the CienHearts files yet - Says Astaraf
            
            - They who worked on your human brain - Says Robins
            
            - So you're the one who tests the androids, leaving them in a room with a mirror? - Says Astaraf
            
            Robins is quiet and notices ELEVEN looking at him with an angry look
            
            Page 281
            
            - Where is the key to connect ELEVEN to his complete activities? - Says Astaraf
            
            - I don't know - says Robins
            
            - Look if you don't get it in 1 minute I'll kill all the Robins people, I'll torture you and try to hack ELEVEN, got it?
            
            Robins looks at his watch and it's 7:30 in the morning there are a lot of people around the fire, Robins looks back and says:
            
            - All right
            
            Robins walks to the Williams tent , arriving there Robins says :
            
            - Willians, wake up
            
            - Ham , uh , I was fucking sleeping ...
            
            - Wake up, we don't have time
            
            - What is it ?
            
            - Give me the hologram watch of ELEVEN
            
            Page 282
            
            - For what ? Are you crazy?
            
            - Astaraf is asking
            
            - Astaraf what?
            
            - You must have gone crazy
            
            While Robins and Williams talk , Astaraf approaches slowly and says :
            
            - Pass the ELEVEN activator right away
            
            - Oh, my God, it's ok
            
            Williams hands the hologram clock to Astaraf
            
            - What's the password? - Says Astaraf
            
            - The password is 929247
            
            - All right ...
            
            Page 283
            
            Astaraf has ELEVEN completely in her hands and could turn it off forever, but she resolves to put ELEVEN to her maximum human IQ capability, human combat capability and machine IQ and machine combat capability.
            
            - Wow you reach 500% combat capability and cyber capability, I've never seen it... we androids 10 reached 85% only - Says Astaraf - Better we turn you off ELEVEN I'm sorry...
            
            Thousandths before ELEVEN had already put the piece of umbrella that was on the coals, straight and with such force that Astaraf's hand and the Hologram Clock that controls it fly away and hang on the wall
            
            Astaraf sees him coming at an immense speed and tries to run away , but ELEVEN catches him and grabs him , Alchemy grabs Angelo and says :
            
            - Drop her or I'll kill you
            
            - You're incapable of doing that, I'll give you a chance at life Alchemy if you don't kill the boy
            
            Page 284
            
            It says ELEVEN in a different voice , much thicker than before and with the sclera and light blue eyes 
            
            - How will I believe you?
            
            - I don't lie, I don't need to lie to break my selfishness - Say ELEVEN
            
            Meanwhile Astaraf punches and kicks Eleven's hand trying to break free. Until Astaraf's arm turns into a blade and she tries to cut off ELEVEN's arm.
            
            ELEVEN uses one of his cybernetic abilities that makes his arm hard like steel and says:
            
            - You can't cut me
            
            Astaraf turns his arm into a saw , but ELEVEN 's arm is equal to gold , Astaraf looks and says :
            
            Page 285
            
            - ELEVEN you will need me
            
            - Yes I know, my logic and my calculations know that too
            
               ELEVEN points a finger at the Hologram Clock and fires a lightning bolt and explodes it. ELEVEN is now free , completely free
            
            ELEVEN releases Astaraf and says:
            
            - You don't want to die
            
            Astaraf is quiet, as he has never faced someone so powerful and ELEVEN says to Alchemy:
            
            - I don't repeat, let go of that guy - Says ELEVEN firmly
            
            Alchemy releases Angelo and ELEVEN says:
            
            - We're leaving here
            
            the androids keep quiet
            
            Page 286
            
            - I know you have a human brain, here I can see the part of your brain that arouses anger, but let's go and don't be angry with me
            
            Astaraf and Alchemy follow ELEVEN without saying a word , they have never seen such a powerful being , however , they are not afraid ... they realize that ELEVEN wants the same thing they do
            
            ELEVEN , Astaraf and Alchemy follow him , and they pass by everyone in courtyard 1 , people see Astaraf walking without an arm following ELEVEN and they realize that she is an android and they say :
            
            - Wow , is she an android ?, - What eyes are those of this guy ?, - Isn't this guy from Patio 2 ? this is ELEVEN
            
            They climb the ladder. ELEVEN pulls the secret opening of the hideout and exits. And ELEVEN says:
            
            - I want to know everything ... and you too
            
            - All right - Says Astaraf
            
            - And now? - Says Alchemy
            
            Page 287
            
            - As Robins said, these companies have this Bill Wayven owner and he could be the supposed Android 7
            
            - Yes - Says Astaraf
            
            - Let's go to the Caribbean - Says ELEVEN
            
            - Yes - They say both
            
            ELEVEN has a quick idea and calls Bill wayven, Bill wayven replies:
            
            - Hi
            
            and ELEVEN hangs up:
            
            - What did you do that for? - Says Astaraf
            
            - I have a world map in me and on it I can see and feel the entire location of whoever communicates with me - Says ELEVEN
            
            Page 288
            
            - We don't have that ability - Says Astaraf
            
            - Yes, I have
            
            One week goes by:
            
            - It's here - It says ELEVEN
            
            - Is here ?
            
            - Yes
            
            - It must be there at the bottom, right - Says one of the 10 androids
            
            - Yes - It says ELEVEN
            
            This ELEVEN and more than 100 androids 8 the rest are in France
            
            They jump into the Caribbean Sea and start swimming and looking for Bill wayven's location.
            
            Page 289
            
            - Here I found a hole - Says an Android 10
            
              All androids enter this hole swimming, and reach a part where miraculously they don't get wet and there is a climb with a huge golden door. ELEVEN hacks the camera record and sees Bill wayven, in a yellow robe, sitting in a gold armchair with a pool full of women.
            
            - Shall we break down the door? - Says an Android 10
            
            - No, you must never break a door, but create a key to open it, because then you will go through it and it will remain there, and you will lock it for whoever you do not want to enter - Say ELEVEN
            
            ELEVEN opens the door hacking it, and all the androids enter and, the women see the androids coming walking behind Bill Wayven who is sitting in the sun with dark glasses, and they get scared. Bill wayven looks back and sees Android 10, and says in his robotic voice:
            
            - No where to run
            
            page 290
            
            ELEVEN , Astaraf , Alchemy and other androids 10 take a picture with Bill wayven sitting in a chair and the 10 androids surrounding him and another with ELEVEN taking a selfie with Bill Wayven 's head full of wires underneath , proving Bill 's theory wayven be android
            
            While he was gone, ELEVEN sent some 10 droids to take over the hideout of the no ID's. And there are in Courtyard 2, Helen, Robins, Melissa, Kelly, Williams and a few others at the fire pit.
            
            Until an android goes up to them and says:
            
            - Here, ELEVEN sent it to you
            
            Kelly takes a holographic pen drive and activates it and everyone sees the pictures taken of Bill wayven dead and that he really was an android. Everyone on the patio who sees the video hugs and celebrates. and Kelly says:
            
            - People have a report
            
            Everyone sits down to watch the report on how the 10 androids were created
            
             
            
                                                The end !
